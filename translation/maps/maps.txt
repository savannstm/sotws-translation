Turn that off.
Fast-forward?
Yes
No
You'll love\#what I found at\#the thrift store.
C'mon, Alex.
What movie\#is this?
It's the\#lessons\#you wanted.
WHOA!
You don't need\#those costly\#schools to smack\#some fools.
We had more\#of these, but I got\#you the one that said:
"Supreme grandmaster course".
It's for experts,\#so this must be\#the best one!
Thank you,\#auntie Beth!
You're\#welcome.
Gotta go back,\#I had Sheryl take\#over for a bit.
You better\#watch this one.
You can\#count on it!
You're a\#born winner.
Hm.
Oh shit.
You\#can walk?
Help me.
Who are you?
*silence*
Uh...
Whoever got\#you here wasn't\#very good at\#keeping you down.
You'd like\#some help?
C'mon, let's...
CAN'T BE!
You have become enlightened!
It feels disgusting. Agility down, defence down.
That\#smell...
You're\#ready.
C'mon,\#let's not\#keep Larry\#waitin'.
He's gonna\#teach you right.
A pile of burned, synthetic fabrics.
Sad sack.
Junk chimes.
The island is taking him.
Offer Rando Coin?
I won't\#need that\#where I'm\#heading.
It's my big day.
So is yours, I can tell.
There are plenty\#of bags to the left.
This is what\#every Garbage\#Islander has to\#look forward to.
It's our calling.
He is gone.
The island\#is calling me.
It's called\#me for so\#long now.
But I\#don't think\#I can ignore\#it anymore...
Tanner,\#Rumo...
I'm sorry.
Big bag for a big boy.
No mags, all bags.
One with the bags.
Sweet dreams.
He didn't see this coming.
Found something!
Kennedy's Binos!
Grave of a "Wiseman."
Never really\#thought this\#would happen.
That I'd\#be...\.\. the\#last one\#standin'.
For the first\#time in a long\#time, I'm feeling\#something again.
Sadness?
Nah.
I feel sick.
Maybe you\#were right.
About...\.\#all of this.
He's not\#what I expected.
I thought he'd\#be... you know.
More cellophane.
Yeah.
Did Georgy\#trick us again?
Empty rain bucket.
When it desiccates, it's the primary\#source of food on Garbage Island.
A proud avian.
It glares at you, it's a queer feeling.
FALLING I:
Living so high up is dangerous.
Taking a short fall is alright,\#but high falls equal big sores.
Fall responsibly.\#- Danger-Conscious Terry
Nah,\#I'll pass.
That thing's a\#choking hazard.
New, huh?
You won't vomit\#forever. It's just\#your body detoxing.
Guys by the\#Black Swan\#help getting\#used to it.
I don't want to\#get used to this.
I bet Larry Davis\#can sort you out.
He's down the\#trash pit, just go\#through the tunnel\#on your left.
You won't vomit\#forever. It's\#just your body\#detoxing.
I've spoken to\#him already.
That Larry Davis\#hasn't set a man\#on a wrong path yet.
What a bright\#mind that\#Larry Davis.
Careful\#around\#Darry.
He throws\#a mean party.
It's suffocating...
You think I could\#get used to this?
I hope not.
I feel\#like a fish\#in a sea\#of plastic...
Heh...
I knew you'd\#get used to it.
Larry D.\#reclaims\#yet another\#lost lamb.
Like a\#shepard...
He passed out.\. Or asphyxiated.\.\#It's hard to tell.
Birds.
It's stuffed with rubbish.
Something is sticking out!
A scandalous magazine!
Ate so much plastic, that it can no longer move.
They aren't moving.
It seems surprised, that you survived.
They seem famished.
So silent.
It's oddly still.
It's broken.
Toxic.
I'm sick of this.
We've been everywhere,\#but the boat.
I'm in charge now!
You joined Georgy's party?
FALLING II:
No floor stands for bad fall!
Unless you know there's\#a secret, you're dead!\#- Terry the Grim Hintz
SOCIALIZING:
Olathe can get\#pretty lonely.
Very lonely.
The lonelier the person,\#the more he will talk!
Talk to people!\#More than once!\#- Friendly Terry
Get that\#shit outta\#my face.
Rando don't\#belong here.
Will ya be\#staying with\#Joel?
No. I'm leaving.
The hell, why\#would you?
This island\#is garbage.
You don't\#just shit on a\#man's home\#like that.
This is\#our life, bro.
Darry following\#you around now?
Here,\. take this.
Got a Bottle of Dirty Water!
You're gonna\#need a drink\#before long.
Can't stand\#that Davis.
Trash is\#trash, and\#there's nothin'\#more to it.
Oh, that's\#very generous...
...but I don't\#really want it.
Not my\#kind of\#garbage.
Reborn in\#trash! Are you...
...the Messiah?
No.
Will you at\#least consider it?
The prophecies\#can't be wrong.
What if\#they are?
They just\#can't be.
Look at\#you, gathering\#your disciples...
Can I\#join-\.\^
Please?
I just\#want to\#share in\#your wisdom...
Do you trash?
Well, I used to\#take trash out.
...don't\#follow me.
PARTY:
Friends have roles\#and work together!
Try to figure out what your\#party members are good at!\#- Terrylicious
THE CHANGING WORLD:
The world\#around you is\#always changing,\#no matter what.
Sometimes it\#happens on its own,\#and sometimes,\#it's because of you.
Be sure to\#check back on\#familiar places to\#see what's different...
...and to make\#sure you haven't\#screwed anything up.\#- Terry-tastic
A bundle of rope.\#It looks long enough to reach the ground.
Kick down the rope?
A shortcut was created!
It's staring off longingly.
It was flattened.
You again?
I thought\#you said you\#were leaving.
I am.
Well, I don't\#know if you\#know this, but...
Georgy's\#boat is the\#other way.
Don't diss\#a man's home\#and then make\#plans to stay.
Something\#about you\#is...\. different.
Larry\#Davis\#is to\#the left.
Tono better\#get his ass\#back here.
Poker with\#only two\#players ain't\#very fun.
Or fair...
Hnngg...\.\.\#Guughh...
Oh.\.\.\#It's you.
What happened?
...Bigass\#Rando\#guy came\#through.
Told us\#to beat it\#or there'd\#be trouble.
We stood\#our ground,\.\#and, well...
Things\#went\#south.
Where\#did he go?
Dunno\#exactly.
Almost looked like\#he went into the\#cliffs themselves.
If you\#plan on\#following\#after him...
...oughta\#be prepared.
Will you\#be okay?
Probably.
But Rumo...
It's\#too\#late.
CROWS:
Crows are your bros.
They'll remember you.
Which also sucks,\#cause they'll then\#go away forever.
- Bird Watcher Terry.
You couldn't\#pay me to\#take that.
This is far\#enough for now.
I'm the\#best trick\#carter in\#the world.
Did you\#know that?
Keep that\#guy away\#from me.
He's all\#sorts of\#trouble.
If it\#ain't beer\#I don't\#want it.
Eight drinks\#in, don't even\#feel buzzed.
Daddy always did\#say I had a high\#alcohol tolerance.
One day I'll\#get off this island,\#go some place to\#really bust my liver.
You'd best\#be careful,\#old geezer.
Scary Rando\#guy's lurkin'\#around this cliff.
He might\#take your drinks!
Someone over\#yonder's throwin'\#one hell of a party!
I need\#to get\#in on\#that action.
Hey! You've\#got a stiff\#drink on you!
Be a pal\#and share,\.\#why don'tcha?
Give Potato Liquor
Refuse
That's\#what\#we like\#to hear!
Lost a Potato Liquor.
Cheers, pal!
Here's a\#li'l somethin'\#from the cooler.
Received Spiked Soda!
Ooh,\.\#my head...
Think I'm\#just gonna...\.\.\#lie down\#for a sec.
You're not\#makin' any\#friends like that!
He'll be fine.
He's drunk off his ass.
Found a stash!
Raddish Gin and an empty bottle!
Messiah!\#Can you\#help me out?
Uh...\.\#What do\#you need?
I'm trying\#to get a\#"royal flush."
But I don't\#know if I\#have the\#right cards.
Well, for a\#royal flush,\.\#you need-\^
Hey!\.\#We're right\#here, you know!
No help,\#Rumo.
This isn't\#a team sport.
But I don't\#remember\#what the\#right cards are!
We're not\#even playing\#Texas Hold 'Em.
Ah, man...
I'm\#so lost...
Wow,\#that smell...
You really\#are one\#of us...
What's up\#with Tono?
He usually\#doesn't take\#this long\#to crap.
Must be\#a real\#intestine\#buster.
He is dead.
Go fish.
We're\#playing\#poker.
Huh?\. I\#thought\#it was\#blackjack.
Same thing.
Actually,\.\#I'm pretty\#sure there's-\^
Are you\#gonna call\#or what, Tono?
Hold on!\.\#What are\#we playing,\#again?
I knew\#we should've\#just stuck\#with checkers.
Hey, hey!
Good\#afternoon,\#gentlemen!
That better\#not be who\#I think it is.
Uh...\. should\#I tell him?
Psh...
Whaddya\#want, Georgy?
Oh,\#c'mon,\#fellas.
Don't be\#so cold!
I was\#just in the\#neighborhood...
...and I\#wanted\#to ask...
...what you\#thought of ol'\#Alex here!
Meh.
I've seen\#better.
But I've\#seen\#much\#worse...
What's with\#the lukewarm\#reception?
You're in the presence\#of the only man to ever be\#dumped in the Mass Graves\#and live to tell about it!
I personally plucked\#him from the jaws\#of death while he\#writhed in corspes!
Doesn't that\#warrant a little\#excitement?
...Meh.
He looks\#the part.
He smells\#the part.
But he\#don't have the\#garbage spirit.
And we\#all know\#that's what\#really matters.
Besides.
We know\#you weren't\#the one who\#found him.
That was\#all Joel.
So don't\#keep peddling\#your fibs to us.
Oh,\. screw\#you guys!
Some\#"wisemen."
Let's\#get outta\#here, Alex.
Is there\#someone\#behind me?
Pretend\#there's not.
Old mattress. Been a long time.
What's going on?
That, was folk\#with the same idea.
Idea to leave,\#I mean.
We're going\#to see Georgy.
He'll be getting ready,\#waiting for us.
Sure, let's go.
Joel Miller joined your party!
Medkit. It's emptied.
You won't believe what I found.
No way.
I thought you'd never…
It don’t look like any I’ve ever seen.
No other would do, Georgy.
So you're done picking salvage for me?
You have to get your own hands dirty from now on.
Not sure yet, but I might be leaving.
Thing is, the bullet ain't the only thing I found…
Glad you’re up.
So, how\#you feelin'?
Confused.
Not so well.
Think an\#introduction\#could clear\#things up.
Seems\#you've been\#through a lot.
I’m Joel, welcome\#to Garbage Island.
Alex.
It's Churchland.
*no response*
A pleasure, Lucky.
Well call me\#Miller then… as of\#now unemployed.
All because\#of you, Lucky.
I see… I’ll\#just call you\#Lucky then.
Lucky?
You're the only\#one they ever\#brought in alive,\#and…
... happened to find\#this right under you.
Reckon, that is\#what you call "lucky".
You have no\#idea how long it\#took to find this…
Ah, perfect fit.
So, what you going\#to do now, Lucky?
Were I you I’d\#seek out the\#guys who done\#me wrong.
I need to get\#off this place.
I know just\#the guy who-
No, I have\#to go now.
You will.
But Rando's\#mobilizing\#his army.
Shooting anyone\#who gets too close\#to the bridge.
Will you\#trust me?
...okay.
Rest up. I’ll\#arrange passage.
Junk.
Upturned filing cabinet. All the drawers are locked.
Locked tight. A note beside the handle reads\#"RANDO ARMY ONLY."
You used the Storeroom Key.
Lord Gao is dead! Rando Rules!
It's a crashed truck. There is something inside.
You found a secret stash!
2 Magazines!
It's a crashed truck.
Everyone here ends up like this.
You used to be a\#garbage man...
How do you\#know that?
It takes one\#to know one.
Though, everybody's\#a garbage-man now.
That's how\#you survive.
What do\#you mean?
Ah, you're\#confused.
Being what\#we are is\#different now.
Listen, walk the path\#of trash once more.
Explore the plastic,\#stroke it good.
You'll KNOW\#when you're\#ready for\#my wisdom.
Heh,\#what's\#this?
Rando think\#he's above\#trading dirty\#pages now?
Mags shouldn't\#be our currency.
It's not\#proper.
But they\#certainly\#are practical.
Face it,\. you're\#not going to\#win anyone\#over with these.
You don't\#give meat to a\#starving man then\#tell him to eat dirt.
Do you\#want the\#coin or not?
Sure, I'll\#take it.
What's one\#more piece of\#trash to add\#to the pile?
Gave away a Rando Coin.
Thanks.
You're\#welcome...
You have given away all your Rando Coins.
You know, there\#hasn't been any new\#trash made in years.\#It is all vintage...
Taking Darry\#with you?
He's a\#good pupil\#of mine.
He'll help\#you on\#your path\#to truth.
Leaving him\#already?
A shame...
You're Larry\#Davis,\. right?
The one\#and only.
I've been\#ordered to\#"assassinate" you.
Is that so?
Heh heh.
And I thought\#that little incident\#back in '69 would\#be the last time...
Now tell me,\.\#who's pointing\#the crosshairs\#these days?
The Rando Army.
They think\#you're the\#"leader" of\#Garbage Island.
Really?
Rando put\#a hit out\#for ol' me?
Seems\#like it.
Well,\. that's\#quite alright.
They can\#have me.
Here, I'll\#show you.
He gave you a Warm Bag.
Added to key items.
That's your\#"Larry Davis."
There's\#no real\#difference,\#after all.
Uhh...\.\.\#thanks.
Don't\#mention it.
You owe\#me one far\#more vile\#than that.
I hope\#they get\#what they're\#looking for.
You are\#changed.
How did\#it go?
It didn't feel\#like anything,\#but then it turned\#disgusting.
Yeah... see you\#can feel it again.\#Feel something!
It's great!
No, it felt awful,\#like it was getting\#under my skin.
I like that\#feeling, I want\#the world to\#mean something.
Trash isn't a good meaning.
Garbage men take out trash.
*Silence*
Trash isn't a\#good meaning.
Well how do you\#think it came to this?
I don't\#know.
Heh... that's right,\#it's a trick question.
It was never\#any different.
You've got\#to appreciate\#what "IS".
Even if it's your\#half fossilized\#mother-in-law.
What did you think\#was in this bag?
That's terrible.
Darry,\#you know\#how it is.
You can\#help him\#to see,\#right?
I dunno, Larry.
This guy looks like\#garbage, smells like\#garbage, but don't\#wanna ACT like garbage.
It don't\#make no\#sense to me.
But...\.\.\#he's still\#a good guy.
That's\#for sure.
I see\#how it is.
It's about\#time for\#you to leave.
The hell's\#gotten into\#you, rags?
You come all this\#way, shag all these\#riches, just to turn\#away at the pearly gates?!
I didn't\#know what\#I was getting\#myself into.
If I had known I\#was turning myself into\#human trash,\. I never\#would've done that stuff.
You\#disgust me.
Trash\#traitor!
You're defilin'\#a legacy here!
Nothin'\#to say?
Figures...
You 'n' me?
We're\#done.
Darry Sweets has left your party.
I think\#you should go.
You know, I think\#it's time you\#should go.
Garbage men\#take out the trash.
Heh... are you blind?\#It's everywhere.
Trash, trash food,\#trash people, trash\#sky and worst of all...
...trash souls.
You can't just take\#the bin out like\#it was Sunday.
There is "man"\#in garbage man.
Good luck being that.
Yeah, you should go...
You should go.
Never again will you copulate with trash.\#You no longer feel disgusting.
Agility increased, defence increased.
What did you think\#was in that bag?
Still warm.
A magazine!
Landfill in progress.
C'mon,\#Larry's right\#over there.
That's right.
Keep going,\#find more.
You'll know when\#you're ready\#to come back.
The bags rustle in the wind.
Let\#the stink\#soak in...
Let it\#burn ya\#skin...
He's paying you no mind.
Ohh...\. got\#those\#cravin's\#again...
Need\#somethin' sweet...
Somethin' like...\.\.\#a gummy worm.
Hey,\#what're you\#looking at?
Scram!\.\#You're\#ruinin'\#my focus!
Trash\#is pain...
And pain\#is good...
Talked\#to Larry,\#did ya?
He'll set\#ya right.
Just don't go\#around shaggin'\#whatever\#trash ya see.
We have\#territory here.
If I catch\#you strokin'\#my riches,\.\#I'll bop ya!
Hey!
You've got\#somethin'\#sweet\#on you!
I can\#smell it!
What is it?
A gummy worm.
None of your business.
Oh, a\#gummy worm!
I haven't\#had anything\#sweet in so long...
Please, just\#lemme have\#a nibble!
Attaboy!\. Now,\#hand it over!
He ate the whole thing...
Ah, that's\#the stuff...
You're real\#nice, boy.
Think I\#might stick\#around you\#for a while...
What do I\#look like, public\#transportation?
This is\#a strictly\#three man\#party!
And who're\#you supposed\#to be, tubbs?
I'm Georgy\. freakin'\.\#Hernandez,\. and\#I'm on a tight\#schedule here!
You got\#your gummy,\.\#now get LOST!
So what, is\#bein' in good\#company a\#crime now?
Get over\#yourself!
I just\#wanna tag\#along for\#a bit!
Are your\#ears clogged,\#you trash heap?!
The deal was\#three people\#and three\#people ONLY!
You are\#not welcome\#in this party!
Lucky...
Side with Darry
Side with Georgy
Side with No One
He's right,\#Georgy.
There's nothing\#wrong with having\#some extra company.
Can't he\#just come\#along for a\#little while?
Oh\. my\.\#Goooood.
Are\#we really\#doing this?
I agreed\#to take one\#extra person.\.\.\#JUST one.
And now you\#suddenly expect\#me to hang around\#with...\. this guy?!
That's not\#happening.
I am NOT going to\#stick around with\#some nasty,\. lowlife,\.\#trash-humping-\^
Then leave\#us be.
What?
You heard\#me.
Go on\#ahead to\#the boat.
We'll catch\#up with\#ya later.
You know\#what?
I will.
And you better not\#be a fucking\.\#SECOND\. late,\.\#or I'm gone.
You hear me?
What a\#blowhard!
You made the\#right choice,\#buddy boy.
Now, let's\#get!
Darry Sweets joined your party!
I'm sorry,\#but Georgy\#is correct.
We did\#have\#a deal.
Oh, is\#that\#right?
Your little "contract" is\#more important than\#having me around?
Well, that's\#just fine\#by me!
Didn't need\#you chumps\#anyhow.
Come around\#again, and\#it'll be your\#funeral,\. ya hear?!
Whew, dodged a\#bullet there!
Next time, Alex,\.\#don't hand your\#food out to\#guys like that.
They just\#wanna\#mooch\#off you!
Come on,\#guys, let's\#not squabble.
Surely there's a\#way to make\#everyone hap-\^
Good company?
Good\. company?!
Pal, you look like\#you were born\#in a dumpster fire!
Just how GOOD\#could your\#company be?
Better than\#whatever ornery\#landwhale I'm\#lookin' at right now!
That's for\#damn sure!
Oh,\. you LITTLE...!\^
Georgy, I think\#you should go.
If you're gonna\#act like a toddler,\#then we would\#rather be with him.
Go on to\#the boat, get\#things ready.\.\.\#We'll be there soon.
And you better not\#be a fucking\.\#SECOND\. late,\#or I'm gone.
You can't\#tease me\#like that!
I'll whop\#you good!
Screw you!
I didn't want\#that stupid\#gummy anyway!
That's right!
Get lost,\. loser!
Well, I never!
Go on, then!
Take your\#disrespect\#somewhere else!
Show him your Gummy Worm?
Eh?
What's that?
Came crawlin'\#back, eh?
Say, why don't\#you hand over\#that gummy worm?
Maybe then\#I'll forgive you\#for that little\#episode earlier.
Give him the gummy worm.
You can't have it.
You're\#askin' for\#a tail whoopin'!
When are\#you gonna\#learn, boy?
We don't\#play games\#around here!
What do\#you mean\#you ATE IT?!
That's...!\.\.\#Gah!
What do\#YOU want?!
Leave\#me alone!
You shag my trash?\#It's your turn!
Well, look\#who just\#came back\#from Jerktown!
Think I\#wouldn't\#notice you\#shaggin' my trash?
You\#thought\#wrong!
Now\#you're\#really in\#for it!
First you\#eat my gummy,\.\#and now, you\#shag my trash...
You're scum...\.\.\#I won't go easy\#on you this time!
Someone's grave.
A map of Garbage Island.
Has markings all over.
New parts seem to have been\#drawn in at different times.
Notes about salvage. Some riddled with\#reminders. One looks like a mantra.
It says: "I am Joel Miller", "I WILL FIND IT".\#There are thousands of notches underneath.
There's a dusty novel lying on the floor.
Found the Book of Tactics!
Added to Key Items.
You found Joel's stash!
3 Magazines, perfume and some mystery jerky!
I don't\#want none\#of Rando's\#handouts.
If he wants to\#give us this crap, he\#should come back\#and do it himself.
Won't be long\#before the gangs\#start moving back in.
Man, I hope the\#Infinity Franchise\#don't come back,\#so rude!
The Honey Comb\#Wranglers though...
...can stay as long\#as they like. Such\#sweethearts.
I guess\#I'll take one.
This don't\#really make\#up for the\#bridge, though.
Them Rando boys were\#in such a hurry they\#broke the whole bridge.
Damn shame.
Guess my\#vacation to\#Hollywood\#is cancelled...
Free Rando\#memorabilia?
Don't\#mind\#if I do!
They said\#they were\#selling official\#Rando masks.
I couldn't\#help myself.
I feel\#cooler\#already.
Uh,\.\#that's\#nice?
No thanks,\#though.
Something big must have\#happened for Rando to\#recall all of those troops.
I saw some of 'em get\#stranded here just like me.
How am I supposed\#to get home?
I spent all my\#nudie mags for a Rando\#poncho and bobblehead.
I regret\#my purchases.
At least\#the fabric\#is comfy.
Where do\#you think\#you're going!?
You must be one\#of the Rando's\#men that got\#stranded.
Ha!
No. I chose to stay.
The recall\#was a sign,\#sent to me\#by destiny!
Me and my posse\#'re keeping\#this place all\#to ourselves...
...and I'm going\#to be king.\#So kowtow!
...and I'm going\#to be king...\#So kowtow!
BOTTLES:
When you are weak, there is no\#shame in relying on cheap tricks!
Never pass up an empty bottle!\#Filling them isn't their only use.
The cheapest trick is tossing\#bottles around during combat.
The higher your attack is the better the\#damage. A weak throw is a bottle wasted!
Know who is the best throw\#and have them use the bottle!\#- Terry the Tosser
It's a petrified garbage gull!
You procure mystery jerky!
What use\#is this\#to me?
I've no\#interest\#in your\#play money.
No way I'm\#getting up there.
Nothing left to do\#now, but sit in my cart\#and let the "winds of\#destiny" take me.
They still\#owe me\#five mags.
I beat\#them all\#fair and\#square!
I just love\#these little\#bobbleheads.
Look, mine\#even came\#with a cart.
Now we\#can race each\#other across\#Garbage Island!
I'll take\#this over\#Fly anyday.
He thinks I'm\#a pushover.
Go prove\#him wrong!
Dang Randos,\#thinkin' they\#can knock\#us around!
Hey...\. I'd\#recognize\#that jingling\#anywhere.
You've got\#some Rando\#Coins on you.
Fuck's sake...\.\.\#they givin' our\#paychecks away\#to trashmen now?
I'm doing\#a favor for\#your diplomat.
Of course\#this is damn\#Hector's doing.
Stingiest motherfucker\#alive on payday, but if\#there's money to waste\#by God will he do it.
Hey,\#geezer.
Mind\#tossing\#me a coin?
I'm one\#off being\#able to score\#an extra ration.
I'll give\#you the\#knife if\#you do.
Eh?\. How's\#about it?
Trade Rando Coin?
Sounds like\#a fair trade.
Here.
I knew\#you'd\#be cool.
Now\#here's\#my end\#of things.
You were given a Combat Knife!
Let's keep\#this between\#ourselves, yeah?
What Hector\#doesn't know\#won't hurt him.
Sorry,\. but\#I was told\#not to give\#any to soldiers.
Man,\#fuck off!
Who gives\#a damn about\#following orders?
Rando ain't\#here anymore.\.\#There's no point.
But fine.\#Be an\#asshole.
If I starve\#it's your fault.
Can't believe\#Rando left us\#in the fuckin' dirt...
After everything\#we did for that\#bastard, too.
What a\#crock of shit.
When I get\#off this trash\#heap,\. swear to\#God I'll kill him.
I'll shank his\#ass and become\#the new leader\#of the army.
Yeah...\.\#for sure.
Oh, thank\#God. You\#got rid\#of Pedro.
That old\#asshole was\#talking some\#mad shit earlier.
Now we\#can have\#some peace\#around here.
Those guys over\#at the camp are\#a real bunch of\#mopey assholes.
...Not that\#that's a\#bad thing...
But at\#least we're\#dry out here!
You've\#made Mikalko\#pretty excited...
He's a\#hard worker.
Whatever he's\#doing, it'll be\#done soon enough.
Check back if\#you want, I guess.
Look at us\#now, trashheads.
We've brought\#real business\#back to this\#smelly island!
Ain't never\#seen so\#many mags\#in one place...
Not even\#Rando paid\#us this well!
I guess\#we have\#you to thank\#for this, so...
Thanks.\.\.\#Raggy.
Gotta get off\#this sinking shitpiece\#and find somewhere\#to spend all this smut.
We can\#finally afford\#some good\#Olathian Whiskey!
This is\#so lame...\.\.\#left behind again.
Why couldn't we have\#gotten stranded someplace\#cooler,\. like Resort Island?
There's nothing\#here except\#trash and\#weird old men.
No offense.
Maybe I'll try\#to make the\#most of this.\#Start a business.
I could sell...\#Rando merch.\.\#Authentic skull\#ponchos and shit.
I don't know\#how the other\#guys stand\#that swamp.
It's so...\.\#moist.
...Oh my God...
...is that?
A little\#Rando\#figurine?!
It's perfect.
He's just what\#I need to get\#some business up\#and running here.
Name your price.
I'll pay\#you.\.\. In smut.
For the toy?\.\#How about...
Hold it!
I know a\#good opporunity\#when I see one.
You've got\#a valuable\#commodity on\#your hands,\. Alex.
Hawk that price!
Wait! Hold on!
I only\#have twenty\#mags on me!
Does that\#sounds like a\#fair trade?
What do\#you think, Alex?
Invest.
Keep the toy.
Yes! Score!
You lost the Rando Bobblehead.
You chose\#wisely,\. my friend!
He gave you his mags!
All twenty of them!
Hell yes...\.\#time to\#get to work!
Nice work, Alex!\.\#You'll be a shrewd\#businessman\#in no time!
Just like me!
Wait wait,\#hold on!
I'll give you\#the mags,\. PLUS\#a piece of jerky!
You know\#good food is\#hard to come\#by around here!
So\..\..\..\.?
Take the goods.
No deal.
He gave you what he promised!
Twenty mags and some Mystery Jerkey!
Damn, Alex!\.\#You didn't tell\#me you knew\#how to haggle!
Your future\#is looking\#brighter already!
Oh, I see.
Well, uh...\|\#My offer\#still stands.
If you\#change your\#mind, you know\#where to find me.
The hell, Alex?\.\#He had an\#amazing offer!
Don't tell me\#you got attached\#to that stupid toy!
Ugh...
...five mags.
Perfectly\#doable,\#my man!
So, do we\#have a deal?
He gave you five mags!
...actually,\. I think\#I'll hold onto\#it just a little\#while longer.
Really?\. Well,\#alright then.
Let me\#know when\#you want to\#seal the deal.
Changed your mind?
Twenty mags and a Mystery Jerkey!
What was\#stopping you\#from accepting\#that the first time?!
Jesus...
Still?
Sorry, man,\#but there's\#nothing else\#I can offer.
This is\#all I've got.
Damn...
Guess you\#must really\#like that\#bobblehead, huh?
This is\#just what\#I needed.
Let's see\#what I can\#do with this\#bad boy...
Zilphis is gone,\.\#and I don't\#think he's going\#to come back.
The pressure\#of everything\#must've gotten\#to his head.
I wish\#things\#could've\#been different.
Hey, hey, hey!\.\#There's my\#favorite\#garbage guy!
Check it out!
The Rando\#merchandise\#was a\#smash hit!
Everyone\#around here\#came to pick\#something up.
We, uh,\#actually\#sold out.\.\.\#Of everything.
Sorry if\#you wanted\#to buy\#something.
Zilphis and\#I have been\#talking about\#things lately.
Our success\#here has motivated\#us to become\#travelling salesmen!
Yeah, we're\#gonna hit the\#road soon enough.
If you see\#us again, don't\#be a stranger!
Part of Mikalko's profits.
A Rando bobblehead. It's been\#placed in a toy shopping cart.
Something is in the bag!

GUARDING:
A good defense\#is the best offense.
In battle,\#it never hurts\#to protect\#yourself.
Guarding boosts\#defense against\#both physical\#and special attacks.
Even better,\#a person on\#guard is less\#susceptible to stuns.
Guarding even\#recovers SP and TP!
If you're ever in\#a pickle, a well-timed\#guard could save your life!\#- Shieldsmith Terry
Wish I had me\#some of that fine,\.\#import Potato Liquor.
Watch your\#intake, old man.
A hangover\#at your age\#won't be pretty!
Neu Crew are dead! Rando Rules!
Oh good! I\#am so blessed!
It's pretty terrible\#being lost\#here, with no\#way out.
I was just\#running out\#of friends...
Harvest corpse?
You got Sean Shawn's corpse.
5 Magazines!
You have salvaged something!
A Dollar!
You drew this?
Yes I did.
What does\#it mean?
Just a\#dream I had...
...of a\#better place.
Where is it?
It's not real, boy.
What if it is?
It's just\#a drawing...
...get over it.
Any other place you\#go will just be worse.
Buddying up\#with Rando\#will get you\#nowhere.
Throw those\#coins away\#before you get\#lead poisoning.
Just think\#for a moment.
I'm trying.\#I spoke to Larry.
What a relief.
That Larry Davis\#never been wrong.
Got into trouble with\#some neighbors again.
They ruined\#your picture.
It was stupid\#anyway.
You shouldn't\#say that.
*Give Chalk*
*Keep Chalk*
Here, I found\#you some chalk.
You have lost the Cockroach Chalk.
It's the same one.
Draw somewhere\#they can't find.
I don't\#fear them.
The things I really need-\#they can't take away.
Thank you.
Don't worry.\#I'm fine.
You are too kind\#for this place.
But you have\#to listen to me.
Nothing will be good\#enough if you keep\#looking outward.
A wise man\#can make home\#out of anything.
Old Augustus\#needs to stay\#out of trouble.
One good\#whack'll send\#him straight to\#the mass graves.
He should\#just get\#a bag\#already.
Find peace\#in the plastic.
Hey! Stranger!\#Can you help\#a fellow out?
I am really troubled,\#for you see, I\#have lost my\#naughty magazine.
I can't find it\#anywhere I look!\#Have you seen\#my magazine?
*Give him*
*Ignore*
You gave him a magazine.
Oh gosh, thanks,\#but this isn't the one.\#Mine had really\#colourful pages.
Please keep looking!
You haven't got one?\#Please, don't take\#this lightly, it is a\#matter of life or death!
Don't leave stranger!\#If you find it I will make\#it worth your while!
I can't find it anywhere\#I look! Have you\#seen my magazine?
*Offer teen mag*
Oh gosh, thanks, but\#this isn't the one. Mine\#had really colourful pages.\#Please keep looking!
What are you\#implying mister?
I'm a decent man.
Don't leave stranger!\#If you find it I will\#make it worth your while!
What's this,\#stranger?
Why,\. this\#isn't a\#magazine\#at all!
I suppose it\.\#IS\. easy to\#get confused\#at your age...
But please, these\#silly coins aren't\#what I'm looking for!
You're my\#only hope,\#dear stranger!
You must\#help me locate\#my missing mag!
Oh, you're back! The\#magazine has profound\#sentimental value to me,\#have you found it?
Gee! This isn't the\#right one either!\#Please keep\#looking! Please!
Don't leave stranger!\#If you find it I\#will make it worth\#your while!
Oh, you're back! The magazine\#has profound sentimental\#value to me, have you found it?
Don't leave stranger!\#If you find it\#I will make it\#worth your while!
Woohoo! Stranger!\#Over here! Have\#you found it yet?
Oh heavens! This is\#really embarassing,\#but this one isn't right\#either! Don't give up!
You haven't got one?\#Please, don't take\#this lightly, it is a matter\#of life or death!
Don't leave stranger!\#If you find it I will\#make it worth\#your while!
*Offer teen magazine*
You haven't got one?\#Please, don't take this\#lightly, it is a matter of\#life or death!
You haven't got one?\#Please, don't take this\#lightly, it is a matter\#of life or death!
Oh tell me you've\#found it, please!
This is great! It's\#not the right one, but\#we are definetly weeding\#out the fakes!
This is great! It's not\#the right one, but\#we are definetly\#weeding out the fakes!
I'm a\#decent man.
Oh tell me you've found it, please!
Alex, ignore\#this chump.
He's just trying\#to scam you\#out of your\#hard-earned pages.
Oh, hello,\#Georgy.
I request\#that you\#stay out\#of this.
It's a very\#serious\#matter!
Yeah,\. it's\#seriously\#bullshit!
Why, the nerve!\#Stranger, don't\#listen to him.
I am simply a\#man in need\#asking a fellow\#for aid.
Is that\#a crime?
God, you give\#me a headache.
Hello again,\#stranger!
Say, what's\#that in\#your hand?
Wha...
That's...!
Erm...
That's not...\.\.\#THE\. magazine\#that I had in mind...
But...\. it\#will do!
Please, stranger...
May I have it?
Give him the magazine.
Refuse.
Oh...\#Ohhhh...!
Come to papa!
He swiped your raunchy magazine.
This is perfect...\.\#better than the\#one I lost, even!
Thank you...\#thank you\#very much!
...What?\.\. Were\#you expecting\#something in return?
Don't be silly...
After all,\.\#you have simply\#returned what was\#already mine, stranger.
Do have\#a good day...
Oh, no\#no no!
Please,\#reconsider!
I'm begging\#you, stranger!
Have you come\#to reconsider giving\#me that magazine?
Don't look\#at me\#like that.
I'll give you\#my thanks,\#but nothing\#more, alright?
Go along, then...
Whoa now,\#stranger!
There's no\#time to\#talk about\#filthy magazines!
Something\#dreadful has\#just occurred at\#the Rando camp!
You'll investigate\#it for me,\. won't\#you, stranger?
Ain't nothin'\#more worthless\#than them coins.
Go toss\#'em in\#a well.
This water ain't\#undrinkable.\#Dirtiness is a state\#of mind only.
Just like being\#in shape or paying\#child support...
Release yourself\#from the "placebo,"\#and you'll be all\#the happier for it.
Stay away\#from those\#Randos, boy.
Them folks\#is nothin'\#but trouble.
Where does\#that rope go?
Some\#damp\#tunnels.
Damp?
Now that\#sounds like\#a good time.
Need to\#check them\#tunnels out...
Do you\#know where\#I can find\#some water?
Boy, you're\#surrounded by it.
I mean\#CLEAN\#water.
You tryna\#imply somethin'?
Look, this\#is as good\#as it gets\#around here.
You want\#"clean" water,\.\#go drink from\#a fish's mouth.
"Clean"\#water...\.\.\#pffft!
Our water\#ain't THAT\#unsanitary...
Pump some water?
You got a bottle of dirty water!
You don't have any empty bottles.
It's run dry.
I swear I've seen\#a fridge move.
Lunatics!
Yet another\#time I saw a...
...honestly, I don't know\#what it was.\#Ugly red thing.
Hallucinations, right?
...right?
Something's\#not right...
I came up for\#a bit of fresh\#air and got\#this awful feelin'.
Is the\#camp\#alright?
It's God damn\#impossible to\#see through\#all this rain...
Cute coins.\.\#Are they\#chocolate?
They're\#metal.
Well, that's\#much harder\#to stomach!
Never gonna make\#that mistake again.
Mmm...\. a\#new arrival?
How\#could\#you tell?
Live here long\#enough and you'll get\#an eye for these things.
Here's a little\#word of advice for\#you, newbie:\. don't\#get nauseated.
That's way\#easier said\#than done.
Well, no one\#said anything\#would be "easy."
Anyway, being\#nauseated will\#slow you down.
Plus,\. you'll\#gradually\#start losing\#your vitality.
Overall, just\#a bad time.
I see.\. Well,\#I'll definitely try.
Kyek kyek...\.\.\#You can try all you\#want,\. just make sure\#to succeed sometimes!
By the way...
Yes?
Your skin,\. it's...
Ah, nothin' to\#worry about.
I just ate too\#many sunflower\#seeds as a wee lad.
That\. and I\#haven't gone to\#the bathroom in\#eighteen years.
How is that\#even possible?
The body learns\#how to recycle a lot\#of interesting things.
Kyek kyek...
Gotten used\#to the island yet?
Not really.
Mmm...\. something\#tells me that\#isn't quite true.
Kyek kyek...\.\#your silence\#speaks volumes,\#my grizzly friend.
I think you're\#gonna feel real\#comfortable here\#soon enough...
I smell blood\#in the air...
It's not an\#unpleasant aroma.
Georgy says\#we shouldn't\#do business\#with Rando.
They don't\#keep their\#promises...
Please take care of Georgy,\#he is very sensitive...
If he gets himself\#into trouble, just tell\#him to check his watch.
They won't\#hit him as\#much then.
He didn't\#even say\#goodbye\#this time...
Such a dazzling\#watch you've\#found, amigo.
It would fit\#so nicely on Señor\#Georgy's wrist...
You've been poking\#your nose into some\#deep, deep trash.
I hope for Georgy's\#sake that you don't\#turn into one of those\#maggot creatures...
I can't go\#into the marsh.
Those\#things are\#everywhere...
...so wild,\#so stinky...
You should\#go now, amigo.
There is\#nothing left\#for you here.
Adiós...
We're here.
Finally...
So that's\#him, huh?
Yeah...
We better\#get a move on.
I usually do this alone.\#Passengers are a hassle.
Being a klutz will\#get you torn to\#shreds by rag\#maggots.
The three of us\#can handle a few\#rag maggots,\#Georgy...
Look after\#the place\#while I'm\#gone, Antuan.
Don't worry,\#putito. I will.
You're the\#king and\#this your\#palace.
That's right.\#Keep safe.
Alright, there is\#profit to be made.
Let's get to\#my boat...
Georgy Hernandez joined your party!
We better\#get a move on-\^
Whew!\.\#Finally\#caught up!
You folks\#can sure\#leg it!
...What?
Do I got\#somethin'\#on my\#face?
The hell\#is that\#guy?
Well, he's...\.\#um...
Joel, this\#wasn't\#the deal.
You said\#there would\#be ONE extra\#passenger!
And there\#will be.\. It's\#just gonna be\#me, you, and Alex.
Hey, what's\#this about\#passenging?
Am I not\#invited to\#your little\#shindig?
Listen, Darry,\.\#we can't really-\^
Of course\#you're not\#invited!
I agreed to\#take Mr. Rags\#over there,\#and him\. ONLY.
That's not changing,\#so you tell this\#trash-smashing\#freak to beat it!
Dismiss Darry
Refute Georgy
*Say Nothing*
Sorry, Darry.\#We need\#you to go.
Why, I never!
Put your neck out\#for a guy, and\#this is the\#thanks I get?
I thought we\#was gonna be\#buds, but some\#friend you are!
I'm\#outta\#here!
Later,\#chumps!
Oh, and\#you wanna\#know somethin'?
I don't\#even like\#gummy worms.
There we go.\.\.\#Now everything\#is in order.
Come on,\#Georgy.
Just let him\#walk with\#us to\#the boat.
That.\. Was not.\.\#The fucking.\. DEAL!
Don't any of\#you know the\#principles\#of business?
Unexpected variables\#like this will sink a\#ship like it's the\#God damn Titanic!
There is no way\#I'm taking that\#stinking,\. humping,\.\#no-good-\^
That's enough,\#Georgy.
If Darry being with\#us bothers you so\#much, then just\#go to the boat yourself.
We'll be\#there\#sooner\#or later.
.\..\..\.Ugh...
Alright.\.\.\#Fine.
I'll go get\#things ready\#for departure.
Don't let your\#new friend\#keep you\#too long...
Or I WILL\#leave your\#asses in\#the dust.
You understand?
Yes,\.\#Georgy.
Good.
Sheesh!
That guy's\#got issues!
He's just\#off his meds.
I wouldn't\#think too\#much about\#what he says.
But,\. we\#shouldn't\#test his\#patience.
Let's get\#a move\#on, Alex.
Sigh.
I'm sorry,\#compadre,\. but\#you can't stick\#around anymore.
Was nice\#while it\#lasted.
Hmph!
If that's how\#it's gonna be,\.\#then that's\#fine by me.
You two\#weren't trashy\#enough for my\#tastes anyhow.
Don't come\#crawlin' to me\#for any more\#favors,\. ya hear?!
Cockroach Chalk!
There is something sticking out of\#the rusted hull of the ship!
'Sup.
You have the\#stench about you.
Go back to\#Larry Davis.
At this rate\#I'll need a\#sleeping\#bag soon.
Heh.
You look\#like the kind of\#idiot to offer\#me money.
You look\#like the kind of\#idiot to fight rag\#maggots.
Knew it.
Rotting.
Halt! This area is\#now under the control\#of the Pedro Army!
No one\#is allowed\#passage under\#any circumstances!
Seriously?
Yep!\.\#Pedro's orders.
As a show of\#our dominance,\#we are artificially\#blockading this path.
Like any\#good army\#would do.
You guys are\#gonna have to swim\#to the other side now!
Heh heh!
Wait, wait,\#wait!\. I'm\#just kidding!
I don't\#want any\#trouble, really.
You guys\#are way too\#crazy for me.
And besides,\#we're not even\#combat-ready!
So, uh...\.\#can you\#put away\#that gun?
Phew...
Alright,\#move along.
Just, please,\.\#don't bother Pedro.
He's all\#fidgety\#and stuff.
The stress\#of running his\#own army must\#be getting to him.
What's this\#bootleg currency?
We only\#deal in\#Pedro\#Coin.
You guys\#are seriously\#wacked-out.
Do what\#you want, just\#don't hurt me.
Pickled.
We're not\#allowed to\#accept any\#Rando cash.
Even though\#Pedro's money\#is somehow even\#less valuable.
He's got passion,\#that's for sure.
It's kind of\#inspiring, after the\#way I've been living\#for so many years.
But can Pedro\#alone really bring\#Garbage Island\#into a new era?
I don't know.
We need to be\#careful out here.
Rag Maggots are\#all over the place.
I'm not sure\#if we have the numbers\#to really deal with\#too many of them.
Can't say I\#didn't warn him.
If he had just\#called us for help,\#I'm sure we could've\#taken care of things.
But he was\#too stubborn for\#that, I suppose.
And so ends\#the "Pedro Army."
The flame was\#stomped out before\#it could even grow.
Pedro...
You said\#they wouldn't\#be a problem...
I turned my\#back for one\#second,\. and...
Why?\.\.\#Why him?
Why couldn't\#it have been me?!
I don't know\#if I'll be able to\#move past this.
Pedro is dead!\|\#He's dead\#because of you!
You're going\#to pay\#for this!
I've heard what you\#were talking about.\#So Georgy started\#taking passangers?
You have a good\#thing going.
This place ain't\#enough for you!?
Hey,\.\#wait.
Those're...!
Gimme that!
Lost Family Photos.
I thought I\#threw these away.
Memories\#aren't trash.
The people\#you loved...
You shouldn't\#throw them out.
Got a Cruel Sack!
The hell\#do you think\#you're doing?
There's nothing\#on the other side\#but endless wastes.
There's a\#reason Georgy\#always comes\#back here...
Do you\#really hate it\#here that much?
Wow, never thought\#he had it in him...\#fightin' like that.
Even though\#big, he was\#always like\#a timid cow.
I have some\#thinkin' to do.
Got a Dull Pickaxe!
It is dead.
For the last\#time,\. get the\#fuck out of my\#way, Roland!
This has\#nothing to\#do with you!
This has\#everything to\#do with me.
To do with\#Garbage Island.
I don't\#CARE about\#Garbage Island!
I'm doing what's\#in the best interest for\#me and my business.
Georgy?
Gah,\. about\#damn time!
Help me\#talk some\#sense into\#this bozo!
Richie...\|\#you should\#have never\#come here.
I don't get\#it. Why're you\#doing this?
*listen to others*
I'm done talking.
I'm done\#talking.
Roland, I really don't\#need any of your shit\#right now. This isn't\#any of your business.
So beat it!
I won't be\#scared of you,\#Georgy! This\#is important.
Everyone\#is upset\#because of\#you now.
Joel, you've been here\#longer than most. You\#of all people should\#understand...
This is good\#garbage...
I got what\#I came for.
I don't know\#what keeps you,\#or anyone else\#here, nor do I care.
Darry...\.\.\#you too?
They gave me\#a gummy worm,\. Roland.
I'd do\#anything to\#help them out.
You just won't\#listen to reason...
You are done,\#we are going.
I won't let\#you play mind\#games with me.
I have been\#out there...\#we all have.
You want to\#undermine all\#that...
...undermine all\#we have HERE.
Augustus...
Forgive me...
Back talking\#piece of trash.
And you!
What the hell\#were you thinking\#back there, Joel!?
He nearly\#decked us!
You just stood there,\#being useless, when you\#could have just shot him!
Shut it, Georgy.
Were it up\#to you...
... you'd have wasted\#it on the first rag maggot\#to flip out at you.
So never tell\#me what to do\#with my gun.
At least we are\#still kicking.
Come on, the boat\#is right over there.
Actually...
I think this is\#where we part\#ways, fellers.
It's been fun,\. and\#I'm glad I decided\#to hang out with you.
But I can't leave.
I've got\#too much here.
There's too much\#trash left unclaimed.
And I want\#those riches\#for myself.
Besides, I can't\#leave ol' Larry.
So...\.\. this\#is where we\#say "adiós."
Why?
Huh?
Whaddya\#mean "why?"
I mean...
Why stay?
After\#everything\#we've done\#together...
Why not\#stick with us?
Come on...
You\#know me.
I'm a\#trashman.
I...\.\. I\#belong\#here.
You weren't\#born trash.
No one is.
This island\#is no home.
It's a\#landfill.
A place\#for garbage.
Not for\#you and me.
You ain't\#makin' any\#sense,\. Alex.
We\. ARE\.\#trash.
That's why\#we're here.
This is\#our destiny.
To come\#here...\. and\#rot and stink\#'till we die.
People\#aren't\#garbage.
Especially\#not you,\. Darry.
I know\#you can\#be more\#than that.
You just\#need to give\#yourself a chance.
Come\#with us.
We'll find\#that chance\#together.
You don't\#understand.
Goin'\#somewhere else...
...won't\#change\#nothin'.
We'll still\#be garbage.
Everything will\#still be garbage.
Couldn't be\#any other way...
Not since\#Pappy died.
I know\#he'd feel\#the same.
No...\.\.\#he wouldn't.
Your dad\#loved you\#for who\#you are.
Are you\#saying that\#all his love...
...was\#worthless?
Man...
How long is\#this gonna go on?
Alex,\. let's\#just ditch\#this chump\#already.
He's just\#holding us up.
Stand Up to Georgy
No,\.\#Georgy.
This is\#important.
What?!
Darry is\#our friend.
We can't\#just leave\#him behind.
Not here.
You are\#officially\#out of your\#fucking mind!
Making such\#a God damn\#fuss over a\#stupid trashman...
I oughta\#leave you\#all here.
Let you\#sort out\#your issues\#in "peace."
Georgy...
Shut\#it, Joel!
This guy is\#really testing\#my damn patience!
It's\#either\#him or\#you,\. Alex.
I'm not\#taking both.
Come on,\.\#let's get to\#the boat already.
It's just\#over here.
...I'm sorry,\.\.\#Darry.
...It's fine.
I know\#what to\#do now.
I'll\#find\#a way.
Get goin'.
After all,\.\#you've got\#somewhere\#better to be.
Darry has left your party.
What a weirdo.
I just\#can't leave.
I just can't.
If that's what\#you want,\. then we\#won't stop you.
Goodbye, Darry.
Later,\.\#buddy...
I don't want\#to stay here\#anymore.
You don't\#know how\#hard this\#is for me.
Oh no.\#Oh no...
What are\#we gonna\#do now...?
You're not\#like Rando's\#people. You're\#one of us.
Once a taboo\#is broken,\#there is no\#fixing it.
We're not wrong.\#Don't leave...
Please...
You back\#off, man!
You have a\#deathwish?!
They killed Bob.
You don't stand\#a chance, Richie.
I'm not\#going back.
Roland\#won't do it...
... he's a\#bleedin' pussy.
You're wrong, man.
He will\#end you.
I know it.
Roland is\#stronger than\#you could\#ever imagine.
You're alright, Alex.
Gonna miss\#you guys.
He's completely still.
Wow...
Never thought\#I'd say this, but...
I'll miss\#that Roland.
There was\#more to him\#than any of\#us ever knew.
What\#a shame.
I saw\#everything.
What has\#this island\#come to?
I'm going\#to Ollie's.
I'll take the\#Trash Lunatics and\#Fly Minetti over\#this any day.
No,\#no, no...
Everything's\#falling apart...
First Bob,\#now Roland...
Next it could\#be Louie,\. or even\#that Larry Davis!
That's my\#boat, Richie!\#Stop that, you\#scum bag!
No. You\#killed Roland!
He was trying\#to kill us,\#Richie.
He was\#only doing\#it for your\#own good.
I really don't\#understand\#you, I could\#never leave...
There isn't anything to stay for.
Please stop.
There isn't\#anything to\#stay for.
My life\#isn't nothing!
I'll forget,\#but I'll never\#forgive this\#abuse.
All I ever did\#was for Roland.
My eternal\#passion.
Sorry to\#hear that.
Whatever man,\#I hope that fridge\#sinks on you all.
Finally.
Get in the boat and\#I'll unchain it.
*Sail to mainland*
I am not ready.
Just great... there is\#a crow in my boat...
Get outta here!\#You vermin!
I am not ready yet.
What...
There are\#some things I\#have to do first.
Are you for\#fucking real?
I bust my ass to get\#you guys here, I\#risk my life... and\#you want to go back?
Slow down Georgy.\#I didn't pay you\#for nothing, we\#are going-
I have a heart\#condition man,\#I can't take\#this shit.
I have trading to\#do on the other\#side, I need to get\#my meds there!
I didn't know-
Fuckers...\#All you care\#about is yourself.\#Get in!
Alright,\#alright...
Just great... there is\#a crow in my boat.
Get outta\#here! You\#vermin!
Some guy in a pit\#told me to hump\#some trash till\#I'm enlightened.
You see...\#I haven't\#done that yet.
I bust my ass to get\#you guys here, I risk\#my life... and you\#want to go back?
Slow down Georgy.\#I didn't pay you for\#nothing, we are going-
I have trading\#to do on the other\#side, I need to get\#my meds there!
Fuckers... All you care\#about is yourself. Get in!
There are some\#things I have\#to do first.

Slow down Georgy.\#I didn't pay you\#for nothing,\#we are going-
I have a heart\#condition man, I\#can't take this shit.
Alright, alright...
Just great...\#there is\#a crow in\#my boat.
Get in the\#boat and\#I'll unchain it.
I am not\#ready yet.
There are\#some things\#I have to do first.
You see... I haven't\#done that yet.
Alright, alright-
To the mainland!
Where is Pedro!?\#I'm taking you all\#out with me!
With Rando gone,\.\#this island is\#Pedro's to rule!
There's nothing\#you trashheads\#can do to stop him!
Ha,\. wussies!
That'll teach\#you not to\#mess with Pedro!
Now get\#outta here!
Go eat\#garbage\#or something!
Just leave\#us alone!
ESCAPING:
Some fights allow the "escape"\#option for you and your friends.
If a fight is just too\#much, don't wait, run!
Running from fast enemies is hard.\#Don't give up on escaping if you fail!
Retreating bravely is the winning move!\#- Terry "The Escape Artist" Hintz
These\#trashmen\#are off\#their rockers!
Nearly killed me!
...Uh...\| Pedro?
Gah! They're\#on my tail!
Keep 'em\#busy,\. Dex!
My empire can't\#fall just yet!
Don't worry...\|\#I'll take\#care of it.
Material\#wealth is for\#lesser men.
Nothing could\#be more valuable\#than me anyhow.
I could be the best\#there ever was...
...eh, who\#am I kidding...
I already\#am the best.
I already\#own the most\#valuable thing\#in the world.
Me.
I've heard\#rumors that\#there are fishmen\#in these waters.
I don't\#believe them.
If fishmen were\#actually real,\. I\#would've seen\#one by now.
Bob was okay\#I guess.
I just don't\#see what all the\#fuss is about...
...I mean\#I'm still alive.
Oh,\. no\#fuckin' way.
I finally\#saw one.
A real fishman...
This water\#just ain't right.
If you fall\#in you might\#not come back out.
Or worse...
Sorry, I only\#take checks.
Is it me or is\#this fantasy...
Fly Minetti thinks he's\#hot shit just because\#he was patient zero.
It would\#be great if\#it stopped\#raining.
Like,\#right now.
Are these\#coins tax\#deductible?
Uhhh...
You can\#count me\#out then.
I only work Fridays...
Okay, maybe\#Wednesdays, too.
Am I\#balding?
A little.
Damn.
My dietitian\#says coins\#aren't good\#for you.
I'm trying not to\#exert myself.
I wish\#it wasn't so\#hard to talk.
Or breathe...
This place\#won't be the\#same without\#Bob in it.
It might\#even start\#smelling better...
Oh, the\#humanity...
A pile of... something.
Bob Versace.
Sinking very slowly.
Don't\#interrupt me.
I am\#in\. the\.\#zone.
Sheesh, man.
Can I get\#some privacy?
Still got a\#couple more\#hours in me.
He has become the object of his own lust.
I don't think you\#know what you want.
"Not this".
You'll never find\#another place good\#as this, buddy.
Just accept it.
I wouldn't call\#this "acceptance,"\.\#rather\. "giving up."
Call it what you\#want, that doesn't\#change the truth.
What kinda\#stunt are you\#tryna pull here?
You say you\#don't want this,\.\#then hump bags\#like no tomorrow?
It's not\#what it\#looks like.
Then\#what\.\#IS\. it?
Larry\#Davis\#will sort\#you out.
Just leave\#already.
I think\#we've all had\#enough of you.
My brother\#was a prodigy in\#the plastic arts.
Second only to\#that Larry Davis.
Cellophane\#decompose\#his spirit.
I know it\#was you.
Dude,\#really?
This is\#a funeral.
Why couldn't it\#have been Roland?
No one has done\#more to fight the stigma\#of garbage insanity than\#the Versace familly.
I'm not\#burying him.
Not it!
Can't be\#bothered.
We'll just\#leave him here.
Why didn't I\#get a balloon?
Not a\#great\#time\#for this.
It has been\#blow after blow.
I don't know\#how we'll recover.
Maybe we won't.
That's\#gonna be a\#"no" from me.
Last time I took\#a handout, they put\#me in an asylum for\#Garbage Insanity.
Those straight\#jackets absolutely\#killed my lumbar.
Sometimes,\#life just feels\#like a pickle.
All green\#and...\. wet.
I hate pickles.
You know, that\#Pedro guy has a\#lot of gumption.
I like\#his spirit.\.\#His ambition.
He's got more\#zest to him than\#Roland ever did.
Maybe I'll go\#join his ranks.
But I\#don't know.
It's not\#good to put\#much faith in\#anyone these days.
Mommy always\#said not to take\#coins from weird\#guys wearing rags.
I miss\#her oddly\#-specific advice.
When I was\#a kid,\. people\#used to tell me\#I looked like a fish.
I must've\#been one\#handsome fish!
It wasn't so\#handsome when I\#almost drowned\#that one time.
Ha! I love\#this Pedro guy.
He's got\#pep,\. he's\#got verve!
Smells a little\#too nice for my\#liking, but hey,\.\#no one's perfect.
I think I'm\#gonna enlist in\#Pedro's "army."
Doing absolutely\#nothing gets a bit\#old after a while.
Hear ye,\#hear ye!\.\#Listen up,\#trashheads!
My name's Pedro, and\#I'm here to finally whip\#this island into shape!
The Rando Army\#has failed you, but my\#posse,\. the PEDRO ARMY,\.\#will set things straight!
Enlist today!\.\#Join the rebellion!
Forgive my asking,\#but what exactly are\#we rebelling against?
Why, the very\#way of life here\#on Garbage Island!
Oh, really?
Yes, really! We're\#gonna make something\#out of all this trash!
Bring life to\#the lifeless!
I dunno...\.\. I\#kinda like sitting\#around, doing nothing.
That's just 'cause\#you don't know what\#else there is to do!
Just think\#about it, alright?
I'll be in\#the marsh if you\#ever come around.
Can't stray\#from the path.
Gotta keep\#on reaching.
I am not like\#the others,\#I do my\#own thing.
I am an\#individual.
I'm close.\#I can feel it.
It will\#be mine.
Keep it,\.\#I'm going\#for gold!
Last one till\#enlightenment!
King me!
You joke,\.\#but this\#is great\#exercise.
Where's Imp?
I can't\#do this\#alone!
I want\#nothing\#except "it!"
There are many like\#it, but this one\#is special, it will\#be mine!
All mine!
I can\#do this\#all day,\#every day!
Won't stop\#until I drop!
Getting\#closer!
I can\#feel it!
Don't\#tempt me.
There is no\#salvation from\#this damnation.
Eternal\#torment,\#thy name\#is garbage.
You found a stash!
Mystery jerky!
Hey, no\#distractions.
This is\#important!
Get that\#trash, Tim!
Just\#one more!
Old payphone. Largely nonfunctional.
Eavesdrop?
...things are\#heating up.
Community's\#facing a major\#upset now.
Can you\#believe it?
One guy wants\#to leave and\#suddenly it's the\#end of the world.
Uh huh.
Oh,\. really?
Then it\#looks we've\#both got our\#hands tied.
...don't worry\#about me.
I've been\#through\#thicker shit\#than this.
I'll be\#fine.
It's everyone\#else you should\#be worried for.
I'll call\#you back\#later,\. Lenny.
Someplace...\.\.\#more private.
Get that\#glinty shit\#outta here!
You'll make\#the whole plan\#come apart!
Hehe...
Those morons\#got no idea what\#they're doin'.
All parta\#my master plan...
While they're\#gettin' higher, I'm\#only gettin' lower.
It's perfect\#"reverse\#psychology."
That's why\#I'm gonna win\#it all in the end.
I refuse\#to lose.
When that bag\#comes fallin' into my\#lap, they'll understand.
Understand\#just how stupid\#they've been!
...I think\#my arms're\#stuck in place.
And my\#ass has\#sunk into\#the mud...
All parta\#the plan,\#I tell ya.
All parta\#the plan.
He is busy.
You found a plate that had broken\#off the crashed satellite.
One of its tiles is loose!
You have got a Palladium Tile!
A satellite piece is missing, it must be close.
The memories...\.\.\#it's all coming\#back to me...
Make\#it stop...
It's all\#just trash.
It's all\#just trash...
Li'l bro...
I always\#knew you\#had it in you.
You're a\#real trash\#spirit now...
I'm so\#proud\#of him.
Get sportswear?
You got an Infinity Jersey!
That's enough.
Empty.
House Dust:\#First stop out of hell,\#last stop before heaven.
Never thought he'd\#actually do it.
He was the\#brightest mind of\#our generation...
He redefined\#what it\#means to\#be human...
He was\#the voice\#of our time...
I thought I had to have a reason to love him,\#so I made all those great things up about him.
In truth Red was the most average man ever.\#He couldn't handle the pressure. It's my fault.\#-Jengo
Wish Garbage\#Island was closer,\#so I could go there...
Just chill.
Clarance\#will take us.
You'd think he\#could hurry up.
Man I'm\#tired.
This place is\#a pit of Hell.
Gonna make sure\#no one else decides\#to come poking around.
Jesus, it's so\#hot out here.
And there was\#nothing good to drink\#in this shit shack.
I better not dehydrate...
Offer a bottle of water?
Huh? You're just...\.\#giving me this?
You said you\#were thirsty, right?
Damn right.\.\#I'll take that\#off your hands.
Gave him your water bottle.
Ah...\|\#refreshing.
You're quite kind,\#Mister...\.?
Churchland.\.\#Alex Churchland.
You're quite kind,\#Alex.\. Better than most\#out here, at least.
I could use some\#company like yours...
You wouldn't mind\#if I tag along\#with you, right?
Not at all.
That's what I\#like to hear.
It'll be a pleasure\#travelling with you gentlemen.
Geen Jean joined your party!
I hate everyone here.
Don't tell them\#I've said that.
Took Clarence long\#enough to scrounge up\#the wood to build\#that dinky raft.
Thought he'd end\#up turning into roast\#beef before he\#ever got done.
Where did everybody go?
Chaz finally lost it, everybody\#left for Garbage Island.
How about you?
I'm good, man.
Sun bleached.
I liked it better\#when there were\#women around...
Eh, who am\#I to judge...
Gotta keep movin' forward.
That's what ma\#always used to say.
She also used\#to say\| "TIDO,\. GET\#YO DUMBASS IN THE\#BED,\. BOY."
I miss her\#most of all.
That there is\#my water pump...
I charge five mags per use...
That won't stop you\#from stealing though...
Yep...\. exactly\#as I suspected.
You're all the same...
No use.
You got a bottle of water!
You're going\#to go out into\#the wastes?
Cool, me too.
They say there's\#a tribe of weirdos\#who live out in\#this desert.
That's crazy.
Who'd ever want\#to live in this stupid heat?
This is it.
Thank you,\#Georgy.
You know, I'll\#miss you, man...
Hate to say it, but\#I'll miss you too.
I know you're\#tough, but...
...nevermind.
I'll be fine.
Georgy Hernandez has left your party.
Not been\#here before.
Feels good,\#smells good.
Thanks for\#getting me off\#that island.
That was\#very kind.
You're welcome, Lucky.
So, I understand\#you're not going\#back either...
Nope, coming\#with you.
If that's alright\#I mean...
I don't know where I'm going.
Why would you do that?
You don't know what I'm after.
I don't know\#where I'm going...
That doesn't\#matter to me.
Why would\#you do that?
Just something\#I have chosen.
You don't know\#what I'm after.
Now why'd you\#assume we have\#to be after the\#same thing?
Since I... we met,\#things been going\#real good for me.
As I see it, you're\#my lucky charm...\#eh, charm-man...
I'm flattered.
Just go wherever,\#see what happens.
So you don't\#care where we\#are going...
You just want\#to be with me.
Lucky... you\#make that sound\#real weird.
No, I think that's cool.
I can't help it.
No, I think\#that's cool.
So it's\#settled?
Yeah, we're\#a team.
I can't\#help it.
So how\#about it?
Alright.
We should\#stock up\#and rest.
...Darry?
Alex...
I just\#want ya\#to know...
...what you\#said means\#a lot to me.
And it\#made me think.
Think about...\.\.\#how things\#came to be.
And,\. more\#importantly...
How things\#will end up.
I dunno if\#we'll ever\#see each\#other again.
But,\. while\#we're here...
I just\#wanted to\#thank ya.
It's nothing.
I'm just glad\#I could help.
Life\#without trash...
It's gonna\#be hard\#to adjust.
But...
I'm willin'\#to see it\#through.
That's\#great,\. Darry.
I'm\#happy\#for you.
Happy\#trails,\. guys.
I hope we\#can see each\#other again\#some day.
Goodbye,\. Darry.
And\#good luck.
I need to rest before we\#hit the endless wastes...
Don't mind Bobby,\#he's just chillin'.
Worked himself silly digging\#up all those clothes.
He is bones.
You search the bin.
Well I'll\#be damned.
A dead man\#walks the earth.
Clarence?
Don't 'Clarance' me.
All this time\#I thought\#you had\#drowned.
Jumped the\#fishing platform\#like you could\#swim or somethin'...
It was... an\#accident.
I got washed\#ashore.
Hmph.
Shouldn't have come\#if you knew you'd\#hate it THAT bad.
I'd best not\#stink up the place\#for "Goldilocks"\#over here.
Excuse me,\#gentlemen.
*say nothing*
Some friend you\#turned out to be.
Yeah, well...
Then come\#to Garbage\#Island with me.
Heh, figures.
DANGEROUS FOES:
In our current landscape,\#it's important to pick your\#battles very carefully.
There are things out\#here that will chew\#you up and spit you out.
If you feel like\#your life is in danger,\#there's no shame in\#getting the heck outta there.
But, if running isn't\#an option, you can always\#try stunning instead.
Using a strong attack\#at just the right time\#might be the key to\#saving your hide.
Stay safe out there!\#- Terry the Traveller
Couldn't find a single\#God damn spot on Garbage\#Island with power still running.
Gonna try my\#luck out here instead.
Is there even anything\#good on nowadays?
I need to find out\#if Saturday night Rom-Coms\#are still a thing.
This is officially my\#new destiny in life.
...Is that...?
It is! You have\#my golden tooth!
I thought I traded\#it away for this TV...
To have gotten it\#back, you must've paid\#a motherload of mags!
Well, it's yours now.
I don't need it, anyway.\.\#Still got plenty of\#other teeth left.
Take good care\#of it, man...
Return the tooth?
If it's yours, then\#you can have it back.
Wha...?!\. Really?
Yes.\. I don't really\#have a use for it otherwise.
You're an angel.
You gave away the Gold Tooth.
Now I have my\#TV AND my tooth.
Life is good.
Thanks a ton, sir.
You felt something warm inside your heart.
Stats increased!
Now, the question\#at hand is how\#I'm gonna put this\#thing back in...
Rotten fruit has rotted away!
The Warm Bag has rotted away.
The Mysterious Key has rotted away.
Alex no longer feels gross.
Is this everyone?\#Ship sails in just a\#couple of minutes.
Last chance, Alex.
I can't go back.\.\#Not now.
Uh huh...\. that's\#what I thought.
Can't wait to\#blow this joint.\.\#Heat's killing me.
It's making me\#feel... frustrated.
The anticipation\#is driving me nuts.
I've spent too\#long in this desert.\.\#Garbage Island is\#calling my name.
I can already\#smell it...
Oh,\. wait.
That might\#just be you.
Flattering.
Can't wait to\#get to Garbage Island.
Been dying to\#lie on something\#other than this\#hotass sandass sand.
Just thinking of all\#that sweet,\. moist grass...
Oh, I'm gonna\#be in heaven...
What's up, water thief?
Come to rub\#your larceny in\#my helpless face?
Silence.\|\#That's right, you know\#what you did, bub.
That's my song!
Sorry...
You got an eerie record!
Barkeep only\#sells one drink.
Even that's\#overpriced.
Overpriced, how\#would you know?
I sold it to him.
Came here all the\#way from Aurora.
Bad move...
The bastard knew\#a starving man\#isn't much good\#at bartering.
Now I'm\#stuck here.
Guess untapped riches\#wasn't the reason\#they warned against\#trading here.
...I'll get back\#at him, slit\#his throat.
God, I smell good.
That guy in\#the backroom is\#awfully nice.
He gave Chaz some\#funny blue candy.
I didn't\#like the taste...
Mister, have\#any blue?
Ten dirty mags for the blue, mister...
*give*
*ignore*
You have lost Joy.
You got 10 Magazines!
Hey! That room is\#five dirty pages!
*Pay*
*Lie* I don't have that much.
You pay 5 magazines for the room.
I don't have\#that much.
Cheapskate!
C'mon barkeep,\#just let them rest.
Whatever,\#just give\#me what\#you've got.
You pay him a magazine for the room.
I'm not\#responsible if\#you get stabbed\#while you sleep.
I'm not responsible\#if you get stabbed\#while you sleep.
It's some of the barkeep's stock.
Mystery jerky, perfume and a diet cola!
His throat was slit.
You thought\#I wouldn't\#notice?
Thieving\#piece\#of trash...
Give me back my\#watch, before\#I waste you.
You have lost the watch.
You have lost the Immitation Gold Watch.
My trowel...
You have lost the Rusty Trowel.
*Done trading, rest*
*not yet*
So...
What's up with\#the gun, Joel?
Used to be\#my grandad's.
Fancied himself\#a hunter...
The illegal kind.
Illegal. Now that's a\#word I haven't\#heard in a very\#long time.
Yeah, whenever\#I'd come see him\#in the big house...
...he'd tell\#me all these\#poaching stories.
Remember any?
Oh.
I was\#never a\#fan of\#hunting.
Ain't exactly\#a leisure sport.
There's always\#something to gain;\.\#food or fame\#or notoriety.
Too many\#wasted bullets\#for my tastes.
I do like\#to fish, though.
Heh, that\#does seem\#more up\#your alley.
I got\#into it when\#I was a kid.
Used to go\#out to the\#river all the\#time with,\. uh...
Clarence.
That guy\#with the raft?
Hm. Long-\#time friends.
I can't tell\#if we're\#"friends"\#anymore.
Why's that,\.\#if ya don't\#mind me pryin'?
Elaborate
"I'm tired."
It's a\#long,\.\#long\#story.
I've got\#all the\#time in\#the world.
Well, there\#was this one\#night,\. years ago...
We were\#just teens\#back then.
We'd just caught\#some big fish,\. so\#we figured we'd fry\#them up for supper.
...I'll tell\#you later.
I'm tired,\.\#need some\#shut-eye.
Yeah...\.\.\#me too.
Night, Joel.
Night, Lucky.
Oh...
He must have\#been a big\#inspiration\#to you.
Wouldn't\#say that.
I thought it stupid\#how he would\#make these\#stories up.
None of them\#were true\#and I always\#knew it.
He probably\#did that so\#you would\#accept him.
Sure. Big game\#hunter sounds\#more glamorous\#than car thief.
That's the thing,\#he didn't have\#to do that for\#me to like him.
Dad said he bought\#the gun at an\#auction, to launder\#some money.
Before recently,\#never even had\#a bullet in it.
I think whatever you\#choose to become...\#or end up, has a\#dignity about it.
As long as you\#accept it, own it.
It sounds like\#he was ashamed\#of his choices.
Anyway. His stories\#stuck with me.
The day the\#flash happened,\#was the happiest\#in my life.
Because suddenly\#all these options\#were open to me.
and I knew\#exactly what\#I would do.
Become a\#lone pistolero\#with an\#empty gun?
Well it ain't\#empty anymore\#and I'm not alone.
That's good, Joel.
It is and\#so is sleeping.
Jesus.
Nasty little\#squabble\#you had.
We were\#never the\#same since.
Even after\#the Flash.
Guess that's\#why he weren't\#too happy to see\#you back there.
He has\#his reasons.
I think it's\#best for both\#of us to just\#move on.
That's the\#"elder" in you\#coming out.
What do\#you mean?\.\#I'm not a\#day over 40!
I just\#hope...
Eh?\.\. You\#were saying?
Well,\. I just\#hope we don't\#have to go\#through that.
We might\#have our days,\.\#but good company\#is good company.
Thanks, Joel.
Now, let's\#get some sleep.
We've got\#a long road\#ahead of us.
You bet.
Got a Cat Postcard!
Chasing Joy?
Have I see you\#somewhere before?
Have you?\| I certainly\#haven't seen you.
Actually, I think\#it's your face...
Oh, the mask?\#Heh heh.
It's the\#mask, isn't it?
Pretty creepy, huh?
You haven't\#done Joy before?
I'm not\#interested.
No...
That's not true.\|\#You have some on\#you right now.
I just happened to\#pick it up earlier, that's all.
Hmmm.
Something tells me\#it's not quite so simple.
But I won't pry.\|\#That'd be rude of me.
If you change your\#mind, you know\#where to find me.
That's not true.\|\#I can see it\#in your eyes.
I think you're\#well-acquainted with\#the taste of Joy.
That sweet,\.\#intoxicating nothingness.
You don't have\#to lie to me, friend.\.\#It's nothing to be\#ashamed of.
It's only natural\#that'd you resort to it.
The human mind\#can only take\#so much punishment.
It was just once.\|\#I don't plan on\#becoming addicted.
If you say so.
But don't forget,\#I'm always here if\#you need a pick-me-up.
That's\#hard to\#believe.
You must have\#some world class\#problems to have\#come here.
Problems big\#enough you'd\#exhaust every\#possible solution.
Joy, well... it's\#like glue for\#broken people.
But let's not\#overcomplicate\#things.
How about this...
I'll give you a\#sample. You work out\#what to do with it.
Heck, these aren't\#cheap, you can sell\#it to barkeep if you wish.
You got Joy!
Thanks...
Just think\#about it.
This sucks...\#I had to\#turn back.
Walked for\#days, but\#there was\#no end to it.
I don't think\#you can get any\#closer to the\#centre than this.
Centre?
The geographical\#centre of\#Olathe... duh!
Out of order.
Normal skeleton.
The well is dry.
Box of ruined sportswear.
Way sign reads: "nothing".
Keep going...
Where's that hat?
He found water, but just a little too late.
I'm wearing it!\#I'm wearing it!
Alright?
Kung only ever\#copied King!
But the jerseys, never\#had an original.
Where did my family go?
Everyone became infinite.
Too hot.
Rest here?
*Offer jerky*
*stay still*
You have lost a Mystery Jerky.
The inscription is too worn to read.
The inscription is unreadable.
It could be anything.

The masses\#will shift again...
Just don't be\#mistaken, no one\#is having fun.

Make no\#mistake,\.\#I'm a\#born killer.

Avert your\#eyes. They\#warp minds.
Sometimes I\#think of\#joining them.
I remember you.
For your own\#sake, find a way\#out of this place\#as soon as you can.
The crowd\#is growing...
A Magazine!
The Gravelord watches silently.
You.\. Old man.
Can I\#help you?
Somethin' like that.
I need pages.\|\#You know the kind.
I'm gonna\#ask you to\#kindly hand over\#some of yours.
Or else...
Things will\#get ugly.
*Refuse*
*Give him five mags*

If you want\#my mags,\. you'll\#have to take\#them from me.
Oh...\| is\#that so?

Don't blink,\.\#or you might\#just end up dead.

You think\#five is anywhere\#close to enough?
Five is\#all I have.
Likely fuckin' story.
You cheap\#old bastards\#are all\#the same.
But don't\#worry.\| I know\#how make you\#cough up the rest.
Gave away twenty mags.
Heh heh...\|\#now that's\#what I like\#to see.
You're very generous.
The world\#could use more\#people like you.
Just be\#careful about\#giving charity\#to strangers.
You never\#know who might\#try to stab\#you in the back...
I don't\#have anything.\.\#Honestly.
Shame, really.\|\#You could've\#prevented this.
Well...\| if it\#isn't the dead\#man walking.
You've come far.
I could\#say the\#same about you.
And all\#alone, too.
Heh,\. I haven't\#been alone at all.
My trusty\#spade's been\#keeping me\#company.
And it's pretty\#good at putting\#unwanted guests\#in the ground.
If you\#know what\#I mean.
Oh, and\#speaking\#of which...
He gave you a skull necklace!
For your\#troubles back\#on Garbage Island.
You didn't\#have to.
But I did.
Now keep\#it close, and\#it'll keep\#you safe.
Just like\#it did\#for me...
Even after walking\#for miles, I still\#end up in a graveyard.
I guess\#this is where\#I was always\#meant to be...
What are\#they, Miro?
Not humans.\.\#Not anymore.
They're like\#wolves now,\#tearing each\#other apart.
No,\. not\#even that.
Wolves hunt to\#feed their young,\#strengthen the pack.
It's natural.
But this...\.\.\#this is\#beyond\#nature.
Turn back,\#travellers.
There is\#nothing you\#seek here.
We're just\#passing\#through.
Even that's\#too much.
The path\#ahead is\#treacherous.
Well, we've\#already crossed\#the wasteland.
There's no\#going back now.
But there's\#no going\#forward, either.
Look into\#the valley,\.\#garbagemen.
What's\#going on?
That's what\#we want\#to know.
Whatever the\#reason, the storm\#of violence rages on.
The heart\#of the crowd\#pulses,\. fueled\#by spilled blood.
It's enough\#to make the\#most sane man\#turn to madness.
If you wish to\#proceed,\. above all\#else,\. you must not\#fall under its spell.
Do not\#look at them.
Do not\#participate.
Keep your\#hands free\#of blood.
Murder only\#drags you\#in deeper.
We've seen\#it happen\#ourselves.
Stay on the\#path and do not\#wander astray.\.\.\#The longer you remain...
...the more\#you want\#to stay.
...I see.\.\.\#We'll keep\#it in mind.
Let's pick\#our fights\#carefully, Lucky.
Best not to\#get involved in\#whatever's going\#on in this town.
Help me,\#fellers!
Don't\#listen\#to him!
That li'l\#cutie's been\#makin' trouble.
Talkin'\#nonsense\#about cities\#and shit...
It's the\#truth!
Keep on\#lyin',\. you\#naughty minx.
It ain't\#gonna get\#ya down.
Come on,\#fellers!
The blood's\#really gettin'\#to my head!
Oh thank\#you, fellas!
You alright?
I left city life\#behind me to get\#away from gangs!
What do\#you mean\#by "city life"?
I was with the\#'Neon Flamingos'\#you see.
The constant pressure\#and lack of respect for the\#flamboyantly challanged...
...just got too\#much for me to\#handle at my age!
Isn't THIS\#the city?
This village?\#You wish!
That one\#is a fuckin'\#megalopolis!
It's east.
I'd go back,\#but hell's\#in the way.
It's alright,\#we'll manage.
Well, have a\#nice spirit fellas!
Better be\#glad your\#face didn't\#pop our ball.
Or it\#woulda\#been your\#funeral.
Tic-Tonic\#never let\#us do this.
This is\#why the\#Franchise\#is better!
Rubber projectile. It has your blood on it.
Hands off!
We looked\#all over the\#town for that\#damn thing!
They just\#don't make\#b-balls like\#they used to...
You got a Rubber Projectile!
The hell\#you doin',\.\#old man?
You enjoy\#gettin' knocked\#around like that?
I'm just\#trying to\#walk past.
It's your\#ball that keeps\#flying my way.
Don't blame\#us just 'cause\#you're clueless!
Vinny...\.\.\#I'm tired.
Can't ya\#go a few\#more rounds?
I need\#a break.
There,\#geezer.
Go on past.
'Fore we\#enter the\#"second\#inning."
Damn,\#baby boy...
He popped it!
Vinny,\#our b-ball!
Help me,\#fellas!
Shush up, you\#naughty minx!
You botched\#it, grandpa!
That means I'm\#takin' you down!
Off to the grinder\#with you all!
Why did\#you do that?
It slipped.
KILL HIM!
He is the\#believer!
The obscurer!
They don't stop\#toying with him.
No-fold rookies.\#This is serious!
Real slippery.
*Return crutch*
*Take other crutch*
*Go away*
You have lost The Crutch.
You got a Crutch!
Crutch obtained!
Well, damn.
Check mate,\#I guess.
Crane chain.
Condition Killer and Mystery Jerky!
A car being repaired.
The phone is smashed.
The tool box is rusted shut.
They are dead.
It is warm.
The monument was vandalized.\#Now it reads:
The poster was vandalized.
...you feel like\#Downtown is getting\#smaller even faster?
Best fix this\#junker and hit\#the road soon.
The new player\#in town doesn't\#know when\#to back down.
The Infinity\#Franchise will\#burn itself out.
The gangs will\#work together.
"The Game" will\#survive and\#continue\#once more.
Doyle wandered\#off without even\#saying goodbye.
He's been doing\#that a lot lately...
Starting to\#get worried\#about him.
He really\#does love\#"The Game."
He just gets...\|\#irritable.
Vinny 'n\#Lin'll be\#back, it's just\#a phase.
But at least\#they took the\#blabbermouth\#with them.
Everyone's been\#losing too much turf.\#The Franchise doesn't\#know how to play.
I suggested\#leaving, but I\#was left behind.
...will you\#be my friend?
Not even my\#dad wanted me around.
Wonder if he's\#even still alive...
Don't tell William,\#but the meeting\#might be too\#little too late.
The Franchise is\#like a plague.
Take your eyes off\#it for just a moment\#and a dozen more\#jerseyheads will pop up.
I don't know if\#ol' John J. can\#stand up to this.
Yo, that's\#my necklace\#you're hauling\#around!
I've been\#looking all\#over for it.
Please, can I\#have it back?\|\#My getup's not\#complete without it...
Return the necklace.
Keep it.
Sure.\. Here you go.
You gave back the gold necklace.
Yes!\. Finally,\.\#my baby's back.
Thanks, man.\|\#Hey, why\#don't you\#take these?
Received two fancy perfumes!
Appreciate it.
It's the\#least I can do.
Sorry, but I\#paid a decent\#chunk of mags\#to get this.
Doh...
Finders keepers,\#damn you!
This whole deal\#is making me\#sweat up a storm.
My necklace...\.\#how I miss it...
I've changed\#my mind. You\#can have your\#necklace back.
You returned the gold necklace.
Yes!\. Finally,\.\#my baby's back\#where she belongs.
I can feel\#my swagger stabilizng\#as we speak.
Feels good.
I don't think\#I can make it\#on my own.
Don't worry,\#the gangs will\#come together.
My ears are\#'bouncing'.
Psst!
Lester's got\#nothing on this!
Just five\#mags for a\#meal to blow\#your socks off!
Buy some meat?
You won't\#get flavor\#like this\#anywhere else!
Party healed.
You'll be back.
My commodities\#are irresistible!
Oh,\| never mind.
You're flat broke.
Just gotta snuff a few\#more jerseyheads out\#and the tug of war over turf\#will be restored to Downtown!
That's the\#name of\#"The Game"!
Can't wait till\#the end of this\#wanton slaughter...
...and going\#back to maiming\#people for fun.

Finally,\. some peace.
Gonna take\#a load off\#before I hit\#the road again.
Zzzz...
When I was\#a tyke,\. I wanted\#to be a coach.
The thrill of\#leading a team\#to victory was\#calling my name.
That plan\#fell through,\.\#but times\#have changed.
I'm finally\#gonna make\#my dream\#come true.
First step to\#being a manager...\|\#is to find\#someone to manage.
How about\#you, pal?
Want me\#to coach you?
I've already\#got someone.
Figures!
I'll keep\#looking, then.
You know,\#there used to\#be a school here.
It was\#stolen, though.
Stolen?\.\#How do you\#even steal\#a building?
They say a\#crane took it.
I wouldn't\#know, wasn't\#here to see it.
That must've\#been a sight,\#whew-wee.
Can only\#wonder where\#it went...
Hope it\#was someplace\#nicer than this.
Green paint!
Well, ain't\#this just dandy.
Wander the\#wastes for days\#and this is\#where I end up.
This place\#looks like Hell\#in a hand basket.
Or was it\#a bread basket...
Point is,\|\#it looks\#like Hell!
You stay\#safe out\#here,\. chum.
Vagabonds like\#you and me\#need to keep\#our eyes clear.
Lose sight\#of the path,\#and we'll fall\#right off.
Manual Scrap!
How am\#I ever going\#to live this down?
Misery me...
I'm a\#filthy\#traitor.

He is...dead?
Stop following me!
Amateurs...
Hey,\. it's my\#favorite rag man!
Jesus...\| we're\#both far from\#home,\. aren't we?
Please, that\#island was\#never my home.
But to be\#fair,\. this place\#doesn't seem\#much better.
I swear, if\#I can't find\#a power outlet\#in this town...
...I guess\#I'll just have\#to keep looking...
Let's crime it up!
This place is\#pure insanity.
And I was\#worried the news\#would drive them mad.
Turns out they'd\#lost their minds\#long before now.
News?
Haven't you\#seen the posters?
There's a real\#girl out there.
That sounds like\#a load of bologna.
It's true!
A war's raging\#in the west\#to see who can\#get to her first.
Good thing we're\#headed east then.
Doesn't the prospect\#at least entice you?
The thought that\#there's a living,\#breathing girl\#somewhere out there?
I had my chance\#with a girl,\. once.
It's been over\#forty years since then.
Suffice it to say,\.\#I'm not interested.
Even if this\#town has gone to\#Hell, everyone deserves\#to know about her.
That's why I'm\#putting up these posters.
Maybe it'll snap\#some of them\#out of their\#lunacy.
Hey, where'd you\#get that skateboard?
Eh?\. I bought\#it off some guy\#wearing one of\#those weird jerseys.
I figured the\#kid here could\#get some use\#out of it.
Turns out he\#doesn't know how\#to use it, so now\#I'm stuck with it.
Tried tellin' you,\#old man, but you\#weren't listenin'.
Yeah,\. yeah.
Anyway, if you\#want it, I'll give it\#to you for a mag.
Sound good?
Buy the board.
Decline his offer.
Sure, I'll take it.
Great.\. Here you are.
Obtained a skateboard!
Have fun, just\#don't hurt yourself.
Oh, no, I\#was just curious.
That's fine, then.\.\#I'll find somewhere\#to toss it later.
I don't have\#any magazines.
Guess I'll have\#to get rid\#of it later.
Gonna have to\#get going soon.
I've got\#posters to hang.
Hey, I can take\#that skateboard off\#your hands now.
Oh, really?\.\#That's good. Here.
You should've seen\#the kid try to\#ride that thing.
It was a hoot!
Shush up!\|\#I'd like to see\#you try and\#balance on that thing!
Heh heh...
Watch yourself,\#old guy.
Downtown is\#a dangerous\#place these days.
What's with\#that look?
Did you\#think I was\#gonna hurt\#you or something?
The knife's\#just for\#intimidation.\|\#Yeah.
Don't mind me.
Just gonna...\|\#keep standing here.
Arnold is true\#brutality!
How does\#he do it?
I joined to share\#in his genius...
I become\#more tender\#with every fight.
Tender or\#not, though,\#I'm still a\#killing machine.
Been putting\#chumps through\#the grinder for\#three days now.
We'll meet\#again, rag man,\#just not now.
I'm still\#decompressing.
I don't think\#The Game is gonna\#make it through this.
There's just\#too many of\#them.\. Way more\#than we thought.
They're like\#a pack of\#gnats, Don.
I'm sure\#they'll get\#swatted out\#eventually!
I hope\#you're right...
It's tempting,\#you know.
It'd be\#so easy\#to join them.
I gotta\#stay strong...\|\#For Fringe Boy...
It is said, from\#meat we come...
... through the\#franchise, infinite\#we become.
Everyone's in\#a tizzy over\#nothing, I say.
Downtown's\#been through\#worse.\. This\#is not above us.
We just\#gotta stick\#together...
The Franchise is\#like a bad cold.
Just gotta\#wait it out.
We'll recover soon.
Shh! You'll\#blow my cover.
Spill the guts!
Who there?!
ARNOLD!
Come back!\#Mo' people!
Drat.
Neon green paint.
Got an Infinity Jersey!
This advert was hidden, but is now revealed.
You took some damage.
The mustache trimmer stopped working.
Now where did\#those scoundrels go?
That danged Kent!\.\#He's slippery\#for a guy\#his age.
Something is in the meat!
Downtown didn't used\#to be so scary.
I mean, it weren't\#exactly peaceful, but\#it wasn't like this.
Them jerseyheads've\#turned everything upside-down.
Say, you look\#awfully young.
How old are you?
Uhhh...\| Twelve?\.\#Thirteen?\. I lost count.
That's peculiar.\| I'm\#pretty sure it's\#been longer than that\#since women disappeared.
I wouldn't know.
My Pa used to\#be a big bachelor.\|\#Got with a lot\#of ladies back when.
Can't remember when\#he said I was\#born, though.
I dunno why\#I'm so young,\#I just am.
I see.
Well, enjoy it, kid.\|\#It won't last forever.
I wonder if\#Pa came back\#to the village yet...
Somethin' about\#that cave just\#ain't right.
You can't\#think straight\#in there.
As much\#nasty as\#it makes me\#feel,\. though...
I can't\#help but\#want more.
Someone's head.
Geez...
Uh...\| is there\#something wrong?
You're what's wrong!
I just\#wanted some\#nice,\. wholesome\#violence...
But you\#didn't even\#fight back!
I can't\#beat up an\#old man who\#won't fight back!
What do\#I look like,\.\#a monster?
God...
Leave me\#alone,\. man.
You're no fun.
At this\#rate,\. I'll have\#no one left\#to play with.
At this\#rate,\. I'll be\#forced to\#play with Derb.
Hey again,\. chum.
I knew\#this town\#was bad news.
Just look around!
They've got\#blood strewn from\#here to the other\#side of the city!
How is\#that even\#possible?!
I'm gonna\#try to hook\#myself up with\#some new gear.
I wager\#I won't last\#long out here\#like this...
This machine is emitting a strange signal.
Break it?
It is busted.
Domestic jerky!
The cave is with\#the franchise now.
I feel more\#intimidating.
Showed you!
I feel jacked up!
Sneaking up on\#big snakes is bad\#for your health.
You got Anaconda Virtue's corpse.
Hey! You...
We're leaving.
Yeah, run\#away,\. cowards!
Can't touch me.
I'm my own man.\.\#I refuse to be\#a victim of\#the cycle.
I have defied the\#ouroboros and am all\#the happier for it.
School Basement Key!
You search the drawers.
Two Tissues!
Become infinite! Join the franchise!\#Wear the jersey! Spread the jersey!
Condition Killer!
It has fled.
Don't hurt me!\|\#You've already\#broken me heart!
Relax. We're not\#going to harm you.
Oh, you're\#not who I\#expected to see.
Is something\#the matter?
Those bullies!\.\#They took me\#skateboard!
Skateboard?\. I see.
We can try\#to get it back.
Really?!\| Oh,\#bless your heart!
I'll be waitin'\#here for ya then.
Be careful, they're\#a nasty bunch!
I'm sure they're\#nothing we can't handle.
Please, ya got\#to get me skateboard!
No!\| Stay away from me!
Ya monsters!
What happened\#to that man\#over there?
I dunno.\. Some\#freak must've sliced\#him up while he\#wasn't looking.
Wasn't me,\#that's for sure.
Say, old guy.
You got any\#pages on you?
I have some\#junk here that\#I'd be willing\#to trade away.
You interested?
Sure, I guess.
Great, great.
Let's get down\#to business then.
I'll be here\#if you think\#about picking up\#something else.
Hey hey,\#welcome back.
Let's not waste\#any time, shall we?
Come back\#any time, okay?
The hole is too small for you to fit.
Barry went\#out looking for\#cigs... he never\#came back.
The Franchise is\#open for anyone,\#maybe if I wear\#this I'll be safe.
If you see\#Barry, tell him\#that I miss him.
It was an accident.
It doesn't matter who\#first bore the jersey.
One franchise,\#infinite kings!
The jersey\#makes men\#into monarchs.
All else\#are reduced\#to mush!
Mystery jerky and 3 cigarettes!
The mutant unravels its jaw.
You got a Baby Crow!
There is something stuck in its jaw.
*Try take it*
*Leave it*
Hello?
Why do you\#people keep\#hounding us?
It was a\#corporate\#decision.
Don't think\#any of them\#could purvey\#an answer.
Pffft.
It's not surprising.
Scared\#of death?
It isn't easy.
Are you seriously\#going to fight us?\#For no reason?
Don't blame\#me, blame\#the franchise.
So be it.
This guy was\#something else.
What now?
Looks like\#we're all\#out of options.
Any ideas, Alex?
It has been...\|\#a pleasure,\.\#gentlemen.
I'll try\#to hold 'em\#off as long\#as I can.
It's fine.
I got this.
Go.
I'm jumping...
After you.
Right behind you.
Run, Joel!
Salt, come on!
Geen, come on!
Pathetic.
You really\#want to\#do this?
...We've got company.
Looks like\#we're all out\#of options...

Alex?
Alex. We have to\#go, now.
Get your\#hands off me.
Sto--\^
Rando's\#nonsense\#nearly ruined\#the whole island.

...like a\#rag maggot.
Got to\#take it\#easy.
Is there\#something\#on my face?
These are beyond consideration.
Don't\#pay me.

What's\#your secret?
I wear\.\#"Essence\#of Dead Fish"\.\#personally.
Where'd\#Loa go?
He's supposed\#to keep track\#of the bags\#we've tossed.
I lost count\#after twenty-\#eight thousand.
Need somewhere\#to get rid of that?
The chamber\#behind me is almost\#full, but I'm sure you\#can find a place for it.
We found holes\#in the warehouse.
Now rubbish is\#bubbling up\#from the bowels\#of the earth...
I've never\#seen so many\#bags before.
Just how much\#garbage is buried right\#underneath our feet?
It's sealed.
I can't\#accept.
Got to\#stay true\#to my own\#garbage.
This is the\#single largest\#trashbag ever\#found.
If there is such\#a thing as pure\#garbage, it must\#be inside...
But I\#need a\#break first.
Hauling\#this thing\#out was\#a chore...
I'm not\#one to say\#no to free\#garbage.
Lemme\#have it.
Some say the\#fruit's rotten.
I say it's aged.
The plywood gives\#them their taste.
Just have a\#smoke if they're\#too much for ya.
You got a cigarette!
Just don't\#give it to\#Roland.
Every once in\#a blue moon, I\#find fruit that\#hasn't rotted yet.
I always\#toss those\#back in.
Can't\#stomach\#ripe foods...
If it doesn't\#melt in your\#hand, I say\#it's not worth it.
Rando's\#trash\#isn't real\#garbage.
It's not\#even nothing.
It's less\#than nothing.
You the guy spoiling\#for a fight with\#the community?
Augustus put you\#up to this, didn't he?
No one had to\#put me up-
He doesn't\#even believe the\#things he says!
This is as good\#as it is gonna get!
Who is the\#bag for?
You.
What is the\#bag for?
Don't pretend\#you care to\#understand.
Leave\#already.
You've upset\#things enough.
LOW QUALITY FOOD:

You got a rotten fruit!
Take another rotten fruit?

Take one more fruit?
By some miracle, the\#fruit turned out to be fresh!
You got a ripe fruit!
The rest are borderline liquid.
Drink from the rotten pool?

Look\#at you!
Lappin' up\#that gunk\#like it's your\#momma's milk!

No, I have\#a much more\#refine palate.
After all, why\#eat GULL\. jerky\#when you could\#eat CROW\. jerky?
I'd rather\#eat neither\#of them.
Oh, don't\#be picky.
I know you're\#just dying for a\#taste of some\#delicious crow jerky.
Alas, I'm\#fresh out.

I'm fine...
Are you sure?
I said, I'm FINE!
Alright, let us\#conclude the match.
Ladies and\#gentlemen!
I give you\#your winner!
That was an\#illegal move.
Ready?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Show more class.
I forfeit.
Go on.
Do not do\#that again.
Disqualified!
Bad show!
Alright, let us put\#an end to this martial\#embarrassment.
TKO!
As long as you're\#not facing off with\#grandmaster\#Sangilak you'll be fine!
Wrong door.
Wow... grandmaster\#Choi Tae?
Uh-huh,\#that's me.
Can't wait for\#our match.
Oh?
Aim high, Alex.
You know me?
I do read\#the bracket.
Didn't think\#you'd compete.
No, I was\#waiting for a\#friend, but she\#didn't  show.
That's harsh.
Don't think too\#hard about it,\#just focus\#on the fight.
Oh, sure.
See you in the finals.
You're leaving?
I have to be somewhere.
We'll meet next time.
Come watch me fight.
Don't miss it.
You owe me one.
Sure thing.
Joel?
Are you\#alright?
...just need\#a moment.
You don't\#look too good.
Geen...\|\#I'm sorry.
A Pink Pill!
Thought you could\#escape, huh?
WRONG!
Think again!
We'll make a new\#canvas of violence\#together!
We'll make you\#a canvas for\#a new kind\#of violence!
I bet you\#didn't think\#I'd make\#that landing.
Eh...he he!
Now take me\#with you!
Now you will\#face your\#most tender\#nightmare!
You got The Bullet.
Goodbye.
The hat of a failure.
That ever happened\#to you before?
This was my first\#and only chance.
I had life figured out,\#but now it's all gone.
So much anguish over\#so little a thing.
Having your whole\#future depend on one\#event isn't very clever.
\^Some people just aren't\#capable of making good\#choices for themselves.
Be quiet already.
Nothing can grow.
Someone tried planting meat.
You got Jessie Mack's corpse.
Grrr...
You made\#orphans of us all.
And the\#Franchise's\#adoptin'!
Daddy Jessie, make\#me a meat momma!
Miggida miggida\#miggida Mack Daddy!
Miggida miggida\#miggida Mack!
All that\#meat drove\#old man\#Jessie mad!
Now he's\#kookier than\#a kookaburra!
I wish\#I could\#be that\#insane!
THEY GOT THE TALL MACHINE\#TO TWIST THE SCHOOL RIGHT OFF!
Nothing but babbling.
ARE THE WALLS SAFE?\#YOU THINK THEY STILL ARE?
Tinfoil Bandages!
THE HOUSE IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS!\#THE LAND IS NOT HIS TO OWN!
Need to\#stop here,\#Lucky.
I'll rest\#a while.
Use your Trauma Kit?
Let's get\#you patched\#up before we\#move on.
You sure\#you wanna\#use that,\. Lucky?
Those are\#damn rare...
Absolutely.
...powerful\#act of\#beneficence,\#Lucky.
Anything to\#keep you\#around.
This thing\#better be\#user friendly.
You have lost the Trauma Kit.
How is it?
Good enough\#to travel.
If only more\#things were\#as easy\#as surgery.
Gotta keep dreaming.
You keep\#going, I'll\#catch up.
Joel Miller has left your party.
I'll try\#looking\#for aid.
You came back?
*Give Trauma Kit*
*Keep Kit For Later*
I got a\#Trauma Kit to\#help you out.
Joel Miller rejoined your party!
Just\#checking\#up on you.
Still here.
Think I\#broke\#some ribs.
Pick berries?
You got nice berries!
He is wearing something!
Leadfoil Rags!
Quite dead.
NOT A CONSPIRACY!\#TIN NOT GONNA CUT IT!
WAKE UP!\#THE SOIL IS ALL\#WRONG NOW!
The bastard axed\#the bridge on me.
I tumbled\#like a big boy.
I have lost all\#will to go on.
A lovely evening\#for giving up.
He's dead.
TRADING:
Most traders use smut\#as cold hard cash.
Some weirdos opt to trade\#item for item instead of mags.
They are always in search of interesting\#curios, things labeled as "barter item".
If their offers suck, you can always\#trade your items for mags elsewhere.
Blood for blood, junk for junk!\#- Barter Terror Terry
State Manual I!
I only\#deal in\#pages.
If you\#catch\#my drift.
I need to find\#some literature.
If you know\#what I'm saying.
It's hard for\#a man these days.
Offer a mag?
Wha-?
No way, man,\#that's yours!
I can't just\#take another\#guy's porn.
...I appreciate\#it, though.
I like you.
If I scrounge\#something up,\#maybe I'll tell\#you about it.
I finally found one!
Hey, no peeking!\#I had to work\#for this, man!
...But,\. since you've\#been so nice to me,\#I'll let you have it.
Grosont gave you his treasure!
Got a Forbidden Magazine!
Don't worry\#about it.
...I'll find another\#one.\. It's only a\#matter of time.
And digging.
Fuck off.
Rando shill.
Everything a\#man could need\#in one place?
This is the life.
The president\#said paradise\#wasn't real,\. but\#we found it anyway.
Are you that afraid\#of Garbage Insanity,\#you'd leave heaven?
They made it\#up, you know?
To demonize us\#poor people...
It's not about that.
Spit in my face\#why don't you.
You don't\#know what\#you want.
You're delusional.
Garbage Insanity\#isn't real,\. but\#whatever you have?
That's as real\#as can be.
Too shiny.
The gulls\#will be all\#over me.
They trade trash they find\#for the junk they don't have.
But it's all nature's\#bounty in the end.
The mass grave is\#spooky and no one\#likes touching corpses.
That never\#stopped\#Joel though.
Wish I had\#found a hat\#like that.
Mighty fine\#piece of\#candy you\#have there.
You know,\#there's this\#guy who really\#likes sweet things.
Darry\.\.\#Something-\#or-Another.
If I'm not\#mistaken he's\#also a follower\#of Larry Davis.
Maybe stop\#by if you\#have the time.
Looks like\#you found Darry.
Or maybe\#he found you.
DUDE!
Visions of\#erotica\#deliver me!
Pfft...
...Brown Raja\#has unearthed\#the ultimate\#piece of garbage...
It's better\#this way.
Fewer things for\#us to compete over.
Guess\#that's true.
Are you\#traders?
Collectors...\#preserving the\#best of the worst.
I'm Ben and\#he's Percy.
If you think you've got\#something terrible,\#we might barter for it.
Not that it means\#anything anymore.
How about\#some change\#for your pockets?
What\#even\#is that?
Hold it close,\#kid,\. our eyes\#ain't what they\#used to be.
It's some\#kinda...\. coin?
Got some\#ugly red\#skull on it.
Ah, Jesus.\.\#Some of\#Rando's junk?
It's a new\#type of currency.
To replace\#dirty magazines.
.\..\..\.That has\#to be the\#dumbest...
...stupidest...
...most\#moronic...
...half-assed...
...utterly\#bullshit idea\#I've heard in\#my entire life.
You've made\#our day, buddy.
Stay\#right\#there.
It's gonna take\#me a while to find\#something to match\#THAT level of garbage.
Give it\#a rest,\#Percy.
Nothin' you've\#got could ever\#compare to that.
Now as for\#me,\. I think\#I've got just\#the thing to-\.\^
You can\#keep your\#stuff this time.
That coin is\#a donation,\#not a trade.
Ha,\.\#nice one.
But nothing\#this worthless\#could ever\#be for free.
Here, take\#this pack of\#expired raisins.
Guaranteed\#chewy for at\#least a week.
Forget that.\#How about this\#doctored photo\#of Calvin Coolidge?
He's playing\#golf in his\#underwear!
It never\#gets old!
I'm serious, guys.
The coin\#is yours\#to keep.
I won't\#take anything\#you're peddling.
I knew\#I'd like you.
A true trash\#saint stands\#before us...
Alright, if\#you insist.
We'll gladly\#keep your\#counterfeit.
I get\#heads, you\#get tails.
How's that\#supposed to work?
We'll\#figure\#it out.
What's a Dollar\#worth anymore?
Bout as much\#as cat piss.
Let me\#have a\#look...
It's a\#counterfeit.
That changes\#everything.
Pocket friendly\#gummy worm\#for that nasty\#paper, c'mon.
No use, Percy,\#I got this.
Here, consider\#this key instead.
I don't know\#what it's for,\#but you know\#you want it.
Key or gummy\#for that dolllar,\#take your pick.
I'll take the key.
Gummy Worm? Deal.
I'll think about it.
You have exchanged your Dollar for a Specific Key.
Nice moves, Ben.
Want to smoke\#this later?
You know it.
Gummy\#Worm? Deal.
You have exchanged your Dollar for a Gummy Worm!
Smart. It'll\#feed you\#for years\#to come.
Just be careful.\|\#That sweet thing might\#attract some unwanted attention.
Hey, Percy, want to\#smoke this later?
I'll think\#about it.
You ever play with\#action figures as a kid?
I had a few.
I was more of\#a Barbie kinda kid.
Who would\#want a toy\#of this bozo anyway?
That means\#it's trash\#by definition.\|\#Trash taste.
And that makes\#it all the more\#valuable to us.
I'll give you an\#old carpet square for\#this trashy plastic.
How about an\#old watch instead?\. A broken\#clock is right at least twice.
Carpet or watch\#for that dinky toy,\.\#no more, no less.
Give me the carpet.
Hook me up with the watch.
Give me some time.
Give me the carpet square.
You have exchanged your\#Rando Bobblehead for the old carpet.
Should've known\#I couldn't compete\#against an offer like that.
What do\#you think?\|\#Should we\#smash this thing?
Of course.\. I'll\#get the mallet.
The watch sounds nice.
You have exchanged your\#Rando Bobblehead for a watch!
Now that's real\#fashion right there.
Give me some\#time to consider.
I think I\#struck "gold"\#with this one.
We'll be the\#judge of that.
Gimme that...
Look, kid.
We don't deal in\#this sort of thing.
It's at\#least fifty\#mags.
Take it to\#a real trader.
Whatever you do,\#don't give it to Georgy.
Something that\#valuable doesn't need his\#greasy mitts all over it.
Can a magazine\#be TOO dirty?
Never.
I've yet\#to see one\#that's shocked me.
...I take it back.
Wow.
Now, I'm depraved,\.\#but not like THAT.
How did that\#even get published?
You should\#take that\#thing to\#someone else.
We don't\#deal in\#mags, anyhow.
How about\#this jar?
Whoa, bro.
Nasty...
Interested?
What's inside?
It's a secret.
Oh, mystery jar?
I'll give you\#a bag for it.
A bag of what?
...bag of unbridled\#possibility.
Ben?
Hm, mid tier junk.
You can have this\#loser mag for it.
Bag or the\#mag for your\#sticky surprise.
The bag, definitely.
The magazine sounds great.
You have exchanged Mystery for a Bag!
This one's\#going straight\#on my body.
You have exchanged Mystery for a Teen Magazine!
I regret\#this already.
I don' know.
I've got\#a dingy\#toilet seat\#for you.
Finally, you\#got serious.
I'm going all\#out on this one.
I n f l a t a b l e  h e a d.
Need I\#say more?
That is one\#solid offer.
You can't\#beat that.
You think I can't?
Don't do it, Ben!
I've been hustlin' and\#rustlin' all my life.
I loved, lost, lied,\#lynched, leached\#and layed so\#many to waste.
Somewhere\#along the way I\#became cynical.
Suffice to\#say, looking\#at that beaut...
...I'd like nothing\#more than to\#dump the poodle\#like a man again.
This is my most\#prized possession.
Your family photos?
No, not mine.
They're\#untainted\#this way.
Just a set of\#beautiful memories.
The head\#or the photos\#for that seat.\|\#Make your pick.
The head...
I would like the photos.
I will keep it for a bit longer.
You have exchanged Toilet Seat for an Inflatable Head!
Think of all\#the asses that\#chafed against\#this baby...
Well played, Percy.
You have exchanged Toilet Seat for Familly Photos!
Damn, Ben, didn't\#think you'd\#go for the\#nuclear option.
I'll keep it\#for a bit longer.
Do you guys\#still have a working\#cassette player?
Think so.\. Been\#a while since\#we last used it.
Give this tape\#a quick listen.
This better be\#'80s rock.\. I love\#that stuff.
I have no idea\#what we're listening to.
I dunno.\|\#I kinda like it.
I think we've\#heard enough.
Hmm...\| how about\#some old TP for\#this funky tape?
These aren't your\#ordinary butt wipes.
They've been\#inscribed with...\|\#arcane texts.
Actually, I think\#it's just in Spanish.
Psh, you\#want paper?\.\#I'll give\#you some paper.
Here, aged papyrus\#scroll.\. Even has\#some weird\#writing all over it.
You'll probably\#be smarter just\#by looking at it.
TP or scroll\#for that funky tape.
I'll take the TP.
Give me the scroll.
Let me think about it.
You have exchanged the cassette tape\#for some toilet paper!
Good choice.\. Quality\#TP like that is hard to\#come by these days.
If this isn't\#played at my funeral,\.\#my ghost will\#be disappointed.
You have exchanged the cassette tape\#for an archaic scroll!
Nice.\| Maybe you'll\#find someone who\#can read that one day.
If this isn't\#played at my funeral,\.\#my ghost will be disappointed.
Let me\#think about it.
What do you\#make of this bust?
It's busty, alright.
Been a while\#since I've seen some\#good ol' double Ds.
You've done good\#this time, my boy.
Let's see what\#we can-\.\^
Wait.
It's got some\#green shit leaking\#from its holes.
Is that a problem?
It wouldn't\#normally be, but...
Jesus, that's fishy.
Can't believe I'm\#saying it, but I\#can't stomach this.
Agreed...
Though I'm still\#willing to overlook this,\#I don't think\#I can offer much.
Me neither.
Here, I'll give you\#some old jerky for it.
I ate a little\#bit of it though.\|\#Sorry.
Some stank\#perfume on my end.
Almost smells as\#bad as that bust.
It's jerky or\#'fume for those\#fishy titties.
Hand over the jerky.
The perfume sounds good.
I'll come back later.
You exchanged the\#mannequin for a piece of jerky!
Apologies for\#the bite.
I was hungry.
It stinks, but\#we'll make due.
Who gets\#the first go?
We'll play\#rock-paper-scissors.
You exchanged the\#mannequin for some perfume!
Try not to breathe\#too hard when you\#spray that stuff.
God, this\#thing smells.
I decided to\#get a little creative\#with this one.
Is that...?
My inflatable head?
And that smelly,\#slimy mannequin torso\#from earlier...
And some weird,\#smelly mannequin thing...
Never knew you\#were the inventive type.
You've mananged to\#make some grade-A\#garbage this time, friend.
Gonna have to\#pull out the big guns\#for this one.
What, are you\#going to offer him\#those pictures again?
Nope.
I tossed those\#out after last time.\.\#I've got something\#much better now.
Boom.\| A really\#fuckin' sharp\#piece of glass.
Nearly sliced off\#my last good toe\#with this thing.
Not bad, not bad...
But how\#about something\#a little more...\|\#edible?
Voila...\| the moldiest\#pizza pie\#in my archive.
Jesus, that thing's\#gotta be forty years\#old by this point.
Somethin' like that.\.\#Still tastes\#pretty good, though.
Grr...\. we're pretty\#evenly matched this time.
What'll it be,\. then?
Sharp-ass glass\#or some pizza pie\#for that sexy specimen.
That glass sounds class.
I could go for a pizza again.
Give me some time to think.
You exchanged the doll\#for a sharp piece of glass!
Seriously, don't cut\#yourself with that.
So...\. about\#the doll...
Nightly rotation.\.\#I won't settle for\#anything less.
Sounds like a plan.
You exchanged the doll for a moldy pizza!
Make sure to\#savor that flavor.\|\#This could be the last\#pizza you ever eat.
Give me some\#time to think.
Come back if\#you found any\#good trash.
...or don't.
Hey, fellow\#entrepreneurs!
What is it\#this time,\#Georgy?
I think\#I've finally\#got something\#worth your while!
Eh?\.\#What\#do you\#make of it?
Not bad,\#not bad.
Better than\#your last\#offer at least.
Uh-huh!
Knew you'd\#like it!
So, what\#are you\#offering\#in return?
I'll give you\#a bag of my\#old toenail\#clippings for it.
Oh,\#come on.
At least give\#him something\#of equal value.
Yeah.\.\#Here,\#Georgy.
Take this bra\#I found the\#other day.
With gourds\#like yours,\#you could\#really use it!
Excuse me?
In what world\#is a razor worth\#the same as\#fucking toenails?!
And I don't\#need a bra!
This chest\#needs no\#covering!
C'mon, Alex,\.\#don't waste\#your time on\#these bozos.
They don't even\#know the value\#of their own junk.
Get some rotten fruit?
You got rotten fruit!
The rest are beyond consideration.
Coins are\#old-school,\#bud, you'd\#know that.
Get with\#the times!
That'll teach\#him, vermin\#breeding scum.
Hey, I\#remember\#you!
Wanna help\#a pal pull a fast\#one on Roland?
Nab his\#little pet\#from his\#shack.
That Roland\#takes after\#his father...
...in that\#they're both\#worthless.
I said\#take his\#crow, not\#his life.
You couldn't\#trade those things\#for a single page\#of a smutty mag.
What\#good's it?
Those two bastards\#in the tent are some\#picky sons of bitches.
They won't accept\#anything even\#remotely valuable.
Worked so hard to\#yank out my gold tooth\#just to get told that it\#"wasn't trashy enough."
Now I've got a\#useless piece of gold\#and a sore mouth.
Fuck everything.
I won't\#forget this\#wrongdoing.
Without any\#Cocola machines\#left, why even\#carry change?
You're just\#wasting space.
Off to\#join the\#Strokers?
Your smell\#says otherwise.
We didn't\#have anyone\#like Davis back\#in Wyoming.
No wonder\#that old\#heap sank.
Food was being grown here.
Dull axe.
Take some soup?
You got a bottle of Soup!
How bout\#that shack?
I've been there.
Couldn't get\#any help.
Stabbed, has scratches all over.
You have found medical supplies!
Trauma Kit!
Worthless.
Who let you\#come in?
My friend\#is hurt.
Can you\#help us?
There is more\#of ya coming?
No it's just\#the two of us.
I thought I got rid\#of all ya vermin.
You, this friend of\#yours and everyone\#can just go to hell\#for all I care.
That trauma\#kit, I'll buy it.
You dense boy?
No. I won't have\#nothin' to do with you.
Please, it's urgent.
I'm taking it.
Fine, fuck you!
Please it's urgent.
Don't you hear\#what I'm sayin'?
Leave my home!
Oh, sorry.\.\#We didn't\#know this\#was your house.
Well, it is!
Now scram\#'fore I cut\#your ass up!
Thought I\#told you\#all to get!
Leave me\#be, God\#damn it!
Is there more\#of ya coming?
You dense, boy?
You again?!
Fuck you!
I'm kind\#of nervous.
What if the city is\#real and I wasted all\#this time doing nothing?
I'm lost in more\#ways than one.
You two related?
In a sense.
We are\#more lovers\#than brothers.
You're talking\#to the EWC\#tag team\#champions of '82.
And I see you\#found my belt.
Oh yeah, here-
You can keep it.\#It's just a thing.
Looks good on\#you brother.
You stuck\#together since\#before the\#flash then?
Ours is a\#bond not\#easily broken.
I can\#appreciate that.
You're all\#alone here?
Yeah, I guess.
You're going to\#the city as well?
Is this place\#safe to rest?
Don't worry.
There's half a\#dozen of us here...
... and nothing\#gets past\#Laser Eye Guy's\#laser eye.
A lot of\#people here.
High spirits.
We've been\#looking to\#make use of\#ourselves.
Then we met\#mister Pike.
He knows\#where to go.
Whoa...
I've never\#seen a medal\#like that before.
Eh.
You\#probably\#stole it.
Back off!
I'm with\#Neu Crew!
Didn't think\#there was\#a Neu Crew\#any longer.
I'm still here.
Don't hurt\#me please...
Where's the rest\#of the Neu Crew?
You're looking\#at it.
I'm the\#last one.
What\#happened?
Rando\#happened.
Hey,\. something\#smells awfully sweet...
You have\#some candy\#on you,\.\#old man?
No...\.\.\#not just\#any candy.
Something\#sweeter\#than sweet.
The very\#peak of the\#sweet mountain...
...a rare\#gummy worm...
Are you\#gonna finish\#that thing?
No, you can have it.
Yes, I am.
Uh, I guess\#not.\. Here, you\#can have it.
Gave away the Exclusive Gummy.
Ah...\#sweet\#delight...
Just what I\#needed to take my\#mind off everything.
.\..\..\.What?\.\.\#Were you\#expecting\#something in return?
C'mon, buddy.\#You know\#that's not\#how this works.
Yeah,\|\#I am.
Fuck.
Whoever said\#"ask and you\#shall receive"\#is a God damn liar.
Change your\#mind about that\#gummy worm?
Yeah. Here you go.
No, it's mine.
No, it's\#still mine.
Stone cold, man.
Stone cold.
First that\#gummy worm,\.\#and now this...
Maybe you\#guys are\#the real deal...
I...
Please let\#me join you!
I've been\#so lost ever\#since Neu died!
But with you,\.\#I can finally\#have a chance\#at redemption!
So?\.\. What\#do you say?
Sure,\#why not?
Y-yes!
Thank you...
I promise\#I'll pull\#my weight!
Shurik Caukaz joined your party!
The only thing\#sweeter would be if\#Neu was still here\#to share it with me...
Ugh, I'm\#thinking about\#it again...
*Rest*
*Not yet*
Mind if we\#sit down?
Mind if I\#sit down?
Yeah, whatever.
Where are you\#coming from?
HA HA!
Just about\#everywhere...
...not many\#places I haven't\#been to.
You?
There's a\#gentleman I'm\#supposed to meet.
I thought\#everyone here\#was headed\#for "the city".
Of course.
It is best for us\#all to stick together\#till the bus arrives.
Lucky for you,\#the city is always\#hungry for new\#labourers.
You know, the midwife\#scene is dead and I'm\#looking to reinvent myself.
I'm versatile\#and they're just\#craving for talent.
Forget babies!\#Time to bring out\#the shine in people!
Lucky me.
Well, it was nice...
It's Pike.
And him?
Joel.
And my\#name's Shurik.
I know\#who you are.
Well, night.
A member of your party has passed.
...you did it, you\#can take it back.
Oh no, this\#is on you.
You can't expect\#me to fix YOUR\#problems-
\^It is either that or\#your friends here die.
\^It is either that or\#your friend here dies.
Whatever, sicko.
Your DEF. has decreased.
Your AGI. has decreased.
You are ruptured.
Your MHP. has decreased.
Your stat growth reduced.
You put that\#down, NOW!
You will not\#harm me.
Damn, didn't load!
This time, you will\#not elude me, Jason.
Don't just stand there!
This time, you\#will not elude me.
You have lost the Pink Pill.
C'mon, Alex. Get up.
There...
Doesn't look good.\#He needs to rest-
Just get us\#outta here.
Quite the...\| mess\#you've made here.
It doesn't matter.
None of it does.

Wha-
What do you mean: "we're on"!?
Right...
Do you remember how back in the day, we had these...
Well, haven't seen one in a long time, but...
...boy, were THEY huge and firm to the touch.
I had one that was this big!
Could cradle it in your arms like an infant.
No kidding.
Now I remember what it's called!
Zu-zuch... zuch-chi-nini-ni-i...
Why isn't there a picture up!?
God damn it, Jimmy! WRONG PICTURE! I said...
Zucc-ch... ZU-UCCHINI!
Can you even comprehend such a thing?
Sin?
I only know what I've seen.
Men giving themselves up, just to forget the pain.
Living of their own shit, and loving it.
All THEY care about is trash...
...like it's all there could be.
And if you show them hope, they turn on you.
Because there ain’t no such thing as...
...friend in a world of violence.
Just brutality for its own sake and nothing else.
So, you ask me, if I believe in sin?
Mystics of trash and violence.
...so it is time to say "goodbye" to mister Rick.
He has made peace with his SANCTIFICATION!
The power cut out.
You think\#that's it,\. Lucky?
You think that\#maybe that's the "City"\#we keep hearin' about?
...No.
Why's that?
It wouldn't be like that.
I would have to give up.
Let's go.
It wouldn't\#be like that.
It just\#can't be.
.\..\..\.Is that all?
A place\#like a city\#wouldn't be that...
Strange?
Violent.
Well,\. I\#suppose so.
But it isn't\#any worse than\#where we've\#been to.
That's what\#I'm afraid of.
...Let's go.
I would\#have to\#give up.
After we've\#come so far?
It wouldn't be...
It wouldn't\#be enough.
...So you aren't\#just trying to\#go "somewhere."
You want to\#find this in particular.
Well...
Not that?
I'm not sure.
...Let's go, Joel.
Back in Wyoming\#we had a garbage\#island of our own.
But it turned into\#a garbage whirlpool.
So I came all\#the way here.
If not one\#Garbage Island\#then it'll be another.
Trash is\#our destiny.
Say, I\#could use\#that for bait!
Fish love\#the taste\#of cheap\#metal!
Catch anything?
I'm not one to\#brag, but...
... I've caught the juiciest\#leather boot. Delish.
Can't wait\#to grill\#this up.
One time,\#I caught a\#real live fishman.\.\#A real one!
Shame it\#didn't taste\#very good.
Way\#too salty.
Can you\#help us out\#for a second?
Absolutely.\#Whatcha need?
We're looking for\#a watch. We were told it's\#floating around in the water.
Do you mind\#fishing it back\#out for us?
Huh?\#Watch?
I actually got a\#watch outta the water\#just a li'l while ago.
But I didn't figure\#that it'd be edible, so I gave\#it to ol' Sysiphus over yonder.
I'm sure he'll\#hand it right\#over if ya ask.
I need to\#keep "all hands\#on deck," if\#you get me.
You try keeping it\#in for this long.
I heard\#you talking\#to Mint\#over there.
Before you\#ask,\. no, I don't\#have the watch.
Jewelry\#doesn't\#do it\#for me.
I passed\#the thing\#over to\#Howling Kebab.
He's over\#by the\#Black\#Swan.
I ran out.
I heard you\#talking to Mint...
No,\. I\#don't have\#the watch.
I gave\#it to\#Howling\#Kebab.
He's over\#by the\#Black\#Swan...
Okay?\.\#Now, leave\#me alone...
They are busy.
They are sinking.
Sorry, I\#don't collect\#coins anymore.
You'll have\#to talk to my\#brother about that.
Here to join\#the Communion\#of Cellophane?
Sorry to disappoint\#you, but I've only\#got singles left.
We all end up in the\#trash bag eventually.
Don't you want to\#practice for it?
I see you've even\#brought your own bag.
"Biff sent me."
Oh, you\#want a\#balloon?
Sure thing,\.\#but I don't\#give 'em\#out for free.
Three mags\#and it's yours.
Buy a balloon?
Sure, I'll\#take one.
We have\#a sale then!
Got a Versace Bag Balloon!
Guaranteed\#hours of fun or\#your money back!
...is what\#I used\#to say.
Actually,\. I'll\#think about it.
Fine\#by me.
I don't\#have that much.
Come back\#when you do!
I don't need this.
Have you\#changed\#your mind?
...How about\#a balloon, then?
What use\#would I have\#for a balloon?
You'll have\#to figure that\#out yourself.
But in my\#experience, it\#never hurts to\#have one around.
Three mags\#and it's yours,\.\#whaddya say?
Ready for\#that balloon?
You'll come\#around to it.
I still\#don't have\#that much.
No mags,\#no bags!
That's\#the rule!
Having fun yet?
Great to\#hear it.
Garbage Island\#just doesn't smell\#the same without Bob.
Maybe we'll\#dig him up\#later,\. let him\#air out a bit.
He is deflated.
Put that thing\#away,\. the crows\#love shiny shit.
The crows been\#tearing up all our\#gulls as soon as\#they start jerkifying.
If their nests\#aren't found,\#we're all gonna\#starve.
Damn that\#Roland, breeding\#those sky rats.
The crows been\#tearing up all our\#gulls as soon as they\#start jerkifying.
I crushed\#those nests.
Sweet.
Do I get\#anything?
You get a\#"thank you."
I crushed\#the nests.
"Thank you."
I'm looking\#for a watch.
Please tell me\#you have it.
Afraid I don't.
Yep. Garbage gull\#snatched it before I\#could even put it on.
It didn't\#go far, though.
Probably still\#around here\#somewhere.
Even dirt\#is worth\#more than\#that thing.
Need help?
What does it\#look like?
The hell you think\#you're doing, man?
You pulled my arm!
Don't touch\#me, psycho!
You stink.
And I don't\#mean that lightly.
You smell\#like a Rag\#Maggot in\#the making.
Go crawl\#in a sleeping\#bag and leave\#me alone!
I don't need\#no copper, nickel,\#or what have you!
Plastic is\#my one\#true love!
Nyuk nyuk...
Hey, buddy...\.\#ya like balloons?
A little bit...?
Louie's got\#whatcha need.
Go talk\#to him,\. and\#say "Biff\#sent me."
He'll\#hook\#you up.
Louie's\#balloons\#are special.
They say\#he substitues\#helium for ozone.
I don't\#even know\#what that is!
What a\#nice balloon\#you got there.
It'll take\#really take\#you places...
Nyuk.
You get\#the stuff?
Yeah,\. I\#bought\#a balloon.
Good boy.
Before Louie and\#Bob came along, I\#never thought twice\#about any ol' plastic bag.
But now I\#can see just\#how valuable\#they really are!
Nyuk nyuk nyuk!
Louie's been\#real down\#ever since\#Bob bit it.
I hope this isn't\#the end of the\#Cellophane\#Commune...
Nyuk...
That'll\#just weigh\#me down.
I'm flying!
I'm really,\.\#really flying!
Flying like\#a bird in\#the sky!
You've got\#balloons tied\#to your waist.
Nooooo\#shit,\. Sherlock.
I can\#practically\#taste the\#air pollution...
Snagged\#a balloon\#for yourself?
The world\#is your stinky-ass\#oyster now, old fella.
My suggestion:\.\#go jump\#off a cliff.
Seriously!
You'll get\#some insane\#hangtime from\#a height like that.
I remember\#the first time\#I jumped\#off a cliff.
Unfortunately,\#I didn't have a\#balloon back then.
The only problem\#with flying like this\#is that you can't\#exactly,\. uh,\. stop.
If you're\#unlucky, you could\#end up drifting off!
Hey,\.\#the wind's\#picking up...
The garbage gull has the gold watch.
You'd try to grab it, but it's being defensive.
Take it forcibly?
Two cigarettes!
Please,\.\#I have\#a pile of\#those coins.
Don't need\#any more.
With Rando gone\#we can start\#moving back in.
What did they\#want with a\#place like\#this anyway?
There are now\#about as many types\#of trash as there\#were normal things.
Rando would\#resupply here.
Fuel mostly, but\#that became\#difficult to come by.
It's always such\#a lovely morning this\#side of the island.
Hey! You got\#the watch back!
Still tacky.\.\#Totally something\#Georgy would wear.
Not like a\#watch is any\#good nowadays.
Can't even\#tell the time!
I heard that\#some Randos are\#still sticking around.
If they try to\#boss around this\#time, we're gonna\#put our feet down!
And ask\#them to\#be gentle.
I'm a\#junker,\#not a\#figher...
Hey,\.\#did you-\^
Clear out\#that safe?
Afraid I did.
Not like there\#was anything\#valuable in there.
Just some\#tacky watch.
What did\#you do\#with it?
Uhh...\.\#threw it\#out, I think.
Yeah, into\#the drink.
I wanted to\#see if it would\#sink or float.
Sorry.
If you still want\#it, you could ask\#someone to fish\#it out for you.
Mint Roger's\#usually out with\#his line this\#time of day.
Step\#back, Alex!
Watch the\#master work\#his magic.
Viola!
No safe is\#safe from the\#hands of a\#Hernandez!
Nice going,\#Georgy.
Uh...\.\. that guy\#up top probably\#looted it already.
No problem,\#though.
Let's go shake\#him down for it!
...I will take you\#to a quiet place...
...tzzt...\#...srch...
Yesterday's news.
Please!\#Take the kid!
D-don't\#hurt me-
Hush, old man,\#it's just\#these guys again.
Hush, old man,\#they're not\#wearing it.
It's clear to\#come out.
Clear or not,\#nowhere's safe.
What happened here?
I was just putting\#up posters when\#they attacked me.
It started when\#my little brother\#went missing.
Pa went out\#looking for him.
All he brought\#back was\#the jersey.
It changed us. It's\#been hell ever since.
I'm sorry for\#your father.
Hope this blows over soon.
Those posters aren't gonna\#hang themselves.
He has fallen.
A ruined child's drawing.
Ruined child's drawings.
It caved in.
THEY DISCOVERED GODS,\#NO ONE EVER WORSHIPPED.
Someone never finished clearing this rubble.
Push the handle?
No use turning back now.
Come, this\#is faster.
Don't trust him, Joel.
Let's follow him.
Your loss.
That it?
Take it or leave it.\#A deal is a deal.
The hell\#you're going?
This ain't your\#community transport.
Who pulls a knife\#on a dying man?
You're still not\#getting on that bus.
We've got\#enough enemies.
Get on,\#we're going.
Didn't you\#hear me?
Hey, Ray!
Ye?
Can a boy get\#some of that\#sweet...
...sweet...
...sound?
Anythin' fo'\#you, Gale.
A way out of here.
Sealed.
Press the button?
The writing is indecipherable.
We can catch\#up with them.
Just leave\#me here, Pete-
I'm not\#listening.
I hope we don't\#run into Cormack.
That dog gives\#me the creeps.
Just need to\#catch my breath.
Or those things\#will get me for\#good this time.
If I never\#eat mud again, it\#will be too soon.
LEARN TO SUCK EGGS\#OR YOU WON'T SURVIVE!
TALL SHADOWS-\#ALL THAT THE WHITE FLASH LEFT.
Whatever it is,\#I'm very busy.
I can't miss\#this call.
So just don't.
Listen, Friend.\#Trust me...
... I don't\#want to talk.
Really!
I thought this place\#was empty and\#now you're here...
...killing the\#vibe. Don't do that.
Please, can\#you just go?
Your phone.
Ugh!
The wire\#is cut.
That's it.
Hi.
Simple.
I let a spin doctor\#in, he plays his pipe...
... everybody\#leaves with him.
Couldn't believe\#they'd turn so quick.
Should have\#killed him.
Would just make\#them even more\#eager to leave.
Maybe. But it\#worked before.
You should leave\#too, the Franchise\#is moving this way.
We're going to\#this city and-
I'm going to\#this city and-
Don't tell me you\#fell for that too.
There IS no city.
There can't be one.\#It just isn't real.
Doesn't matter\#if you have\#to go anyway.
You think I\#can't handle a\#few punks?
It's not like\#that, there is a-
Ten mags say, I,\#could beat YOU both.
Ten mags say, I,\#could beat YOU.
You!? I...
I'm done with you.
You're conceited.
...we can try.
I'm done\#with you.
Run along,\#coward.
You're\#conceited.
No, I'm just\#angry and bored.
Hello.
Man of few words?
I could get you\#some mud pies.
...Nobody is left\#to share them with.
Don't tell me you\#fell for the same\#thing too.
That look in your\#eyes...
I think I understand.
You've changed\#your mind?
I'll take you on.
Thought\#as much.
I'll take\#you on.
Maybe you\#aren't a\#coward then.
I've done so much\#to make this place work.
Now, it's\#gone...
Find Jason Pike.\#If that place is real,\#HE knows where it is.
It takes much\#more to stay put than\#it looks, you know?
Why don't YOU\#give THAT a go?
Fitting.
Makes more\#sense this way.
Get mud pies?
You got six Mud Pies!
Get contents?
You got two Mud Pies!
Champion's Belt!
You got four Mud Pies!
Drawing of a familly.
Diet Cocola Cola!
Some force beckons from beyond the wall.
You hear a faint beating.
Silence.
You hear a pounding heart.
Piercing silence.
No going back.
You are changed. ATK. increased.
DEF. decreased.
This is a\#mistake.
The papers\#don't lie.
The Infinity\#Franchise wishes\#you a swell day.
Next!
Ah, there\#you are.
Alex Churchland.
You've got\#at least eight\#kills under your belt.
Hm...
Welcome to:\#"The first fold to infinity"!
Congratulations!\#Your senseless violence\#has earned you the\#privilage...
...of striving for the\#second fold at sixteen\#consecutive kills.
That means\#sixteen MORE kills.
And they've got\#to be both senseless\#AND consecutive...
...where's your jersey?
Doesn't matter.
Just one\#formality left.
Kill your\#inner child.
What!? NO!
Okay.
Avatar of\#your hatred.
What's poppin',\#daddy-o?
Look at me,\#I'm human-trash.
I'm leaving.
Hey! You\#can't do that!
I'll make this\#square, blow his jets.
Well done.
Hey! Lester's\#happy to see\#you again!
Here, for\#lending me a\#hand back there.
Received ten tomato sauce packets!
It was\#the least\#we could do.
Appreciated\#all the same.
Now, let's\#get to business.
Come, browse\#my meats.
Just remember:\#"chew with your good teeth".
Normal people!
I'm one of you!
Here's Anaconda.
Well I'll be.
I thought him too\#slippery to catch!
Hand over\#that snake!
You have lost Anaconda Virtue.
Here! To\#pest control!
You got Stew in a Bag and Potato Liqueur.
Meet Kindchild.
Oh, I'll "meat" him\#alright, he he.
You have lost Stefan Kindchild.
I call this:\#'Moe's special'.
You receive two Moe's Special Blends.
Lester...
... are we\#eating people?
Of course not!
It's all\#immitation pork.
Tastes just\#like real pork!
I've got Mack.
Jessie the "your food\#gives me the meat\#sweats" Mack.
You have lost Jessie Mack.
I have an idea!\#A packet for every\#bastard this\#prick spawned!
You got sixteen Tomato Sauce Packets.
That is all three\#of them, Lester.
A task that only a\#profoundly normal\#man could complete.
I have to\#come clean...
...I am a slimy\#liar, not like\#you two.
Immitation pork\#actually tastes\#like chicken.
And it does give\#you meat sweats.
I know,\#it's okay.
You're making me\#feel all emotional.
Receive my most\#powerful meat!
You got Antique Ham!
You didn't have to.
Let's all share it, Lester.
Let's all share\#it together, Lester.
You have lost Antique Ham.
Don't touch the stuff\#you find on the ground.
It's all sorts\#of wrong!
Kill some\#for Lester!
The menu isn't\#getting any bigger.
Lester's most wanted.
What did\#they do?
Oh, they're the most\#evil kind of person...
...MOOCHES!
Bring me their\#bodies and there\#will be grub for you.
Why not just\#the heads?
Uh, no. Those\#could be anyone's.
Hey, want some\#grub on the house?
Get rid of\#those three in\#the posters.
Oh, and once\#you're done, bring\#me their bodies.
...hard times,\#Lester dear.
You all talk\#in riddles now?
Crack his skull!
Muzzle your pet,\#he's making\#me nervous.
He's just a hungry\#man speaking his mind.
Crack his skull,\#crack his skull!
Make him STOP!
You sweatin'\#bullets there.
CRACK HIS SKULL,\#CRACK HIS SKULL!
Hey, friends!\|\#Mind givin' ol'\#Lester a hand?
Hey, you there.\|\#Mind givin'\#me a hand?
Help him.
Stay silent.
Hey, you two.
Back away\#from the counter.
Oh, who's this?
More to join\#in our feast?
More meat,\.\#more meat!
Mmm...\.\#how enticing...
Come, Wing.
Let us partake.
MEAT TIME,\#MEAT TIME!
Now what was that\#supposed to prove?
Earned 285 experience points.
Found Condition Killer and a Nugget.
CRACK\. HIS\. SKULL!\|\#CRACK\. HIS\. SKULL!
I guess that's\#a "no" then.
Oh,\. Lester,\.\#what fun times\#we will ha-\^
Now what is that\#supposed to prove?
It looks peaceful.
They say that\#at the bottom of\#these cliffs lies a\#town full of treasure.
A place abandoned\#by society,\. and\#abandoned by time.
If you look\#hard enough, you\#can almost see it...
There's no way\#to get down there\#from here, though.
You'd have to\#jump,\. and I think\#we both know how\#that story ends.
Unless you\#had a parachute\#or some other way\#to slow your fall...
Use the Bag Balloon to descend?
Hold on\#there, Lucky.
You sure\#you wanna go\#through with this?
That\#balloon\#you got...
You really think\#it'll get ya down the\#cliff safe and sound?
Far as I can\#tell, it's just\#a blown-up\#trash bag.
Insist on jumping.
Heed Joel's advice.
I have a\#special feeling\#about this balloon,\#cheesy as that is.
For some\#reason,\.\#I think\#I'll be fine.
Well,\.\. you\#seem pretty\#adamant\#about this.
I won't\#try to-\^
Alex, no\#offense,\. but\#have you lost\#your mind?!
I was fine\#with you taking\#your time to\#get to the boat...
But this is\#fucking ridiculous!
Jumping off\#cliffs?\. What,\#you suicidal all\#of a sudden?!
Joel,\. are you sure\#he doesn't have some sort\#of weird brain condition from\#lying around those corpses?
He's a\#free man,\.\#Georgy.
Can't deny\#him his\#impulses.
Oh\. my\. Gooood...
Fine.\.\. Jump off\#as many cliffs\#as you want.
I'll be\#at the boat.
And if you\#don't turn up,\.\#I'm leaving\#without you.
You\#got that?
I said-\^
Yes,\#Georgy.
We\#get it.
Have "fun"\#down there.
I won't\#try to\#stop ya.
Guess we'll\#meet back\#up later, then.
Take care\#down there, Lucky.
Alright,\#I'm jumping.
When you put\#it like that,\. this\#idea sounds a\#whole lot worse.
Yeah...\.\#just\#a little.
You gonna\#fly back down\#there,\. rag guy?
No.\|\#Not in a\#million years.
It is hatched.
The stench is too strong.
Ey, man!
You ain't messing\#with that shack.
You're new\#or something?
If Georgy does\#anything again, it\#will be YOUR hide...
... and don't tell\#Roland I was here.
Hey, guys!
Hey, Joel!
Guys, it's me!
Joel, it's me!
Up here!
Lucky!
Good to see you!
There's my boy!
Get down\#here already!
You rejoined your party!
Georgy's gonna\#ditch us if\#we lollygag\#any longer.
Let's move.
Steal baby crow?
Return other baby.
You have lost a Baby Crow.
Happy chicks.
3 Magazines!
Siamese twins skeletons.
State Manual II!
You resist the\#jersey, but HE will\#transform you.
It was but a\#brief encounter, yet\#I've learned so much.
They are all dead.
Did you...\. follow\#me all the\#way out here?
Not gonna lie,\.\#I respect the hustle.
Here,\. you've\#earned it.
He gave you a charred ring!
Uh,\| thanks.
Don't mention it.
Until we meet again.
Hole full of sportswear.
That clever\#Kindchild's set\#up weird satellites\#all across town!
No telling\#what that\#fat bastard's\#up to now!
I bet he\#wants to melt\#our brains with\#radio waves!
Or turn\#our eyeballs\#inside-out!
If you see\#any of those\#satellites,\. go ahead\#and fuck 'em up!
Keep our\#heads from\#turning into\#popcorn!
Mr. A-a-arnold?
Oh, God!\#It IS you!
You are\#my idol-
The car is busted.
License plate reads: "BAD".
Geen?
Oh,\. there\#you guys are.
Some jersey\#chump was\#running amok\#out here.
I took care\#of him, though.
Let's get\#outta here.
This place\#is skeevy\#as fuck.
Managed to\#find a new\#outfit, but\#not much else.
All these "Game"\#players have already\#pilfered most of\#the good stuff.
Pft,\. some\#GAME this is.
Where I come\#from,\. our idea\#of a game was\#much more peaceful.
Kick a ball\#around the block\#or go swimming\#in the lake...
Nothing like\#this malarkey.
This whole\#apocalypse business\#has turned everyone's\#minds topsy-turvy.
Warped their...\|\#perceptions.
Everyone says\#they're gonna fix\#"The Game" tonight.
I hope so.
All tension\#is making\#me tear up...
I feel\#like a...
What's that\#vegetable again?
It's jammed.
You search the dumpster.
Some Rotten Fruit!
The generator is fried.
You got Stefan Kindchild's corpse.
Mouldy books.
Who are you\#supposed to be?
Um, we live here.
We were just leaving.*leave*
Ugh! That name\#is so bland.
Um, we\#live here.
Oh, so you're\#the host.
Fresh-cool.
We were\#just leaving.
Oh shit,\#I'm late?
I'm not carpooling with\#Fringe Boy anymore.
Oh look\#at that!
You two must\#really love\#my meat.
Go on, take\#a seat.
Ah! Fellow\#normal people!
Come, sit.
Lester's got\#enough meat\#for everybody!
Lester! My boy!
That you, Salty?
You bet\#your ass,\. HA HA!
Heh, now\#it's a party!
Wanna help\#me salt\#the meat?
Do you\#even need\#to ask?\. HA HA!
Let's see where\#this goes, Joel.
Won't object\#to hospitality.
Hey,\. what gives?
Ain't got\#a seat\#for me?
Uh, well...
I've heard\#the carpet's\#pretty comfy.
Psh,\. assholes.
Sup' bitches!
Not this fresh\#hell again.
Stop pretending\#you're my MOM!
This better\#work or I'm out.
Bitchin'.
The sssound\#beckonsss.

Damn, baby.\#Do my eyes\#deceive me?
No tricks.\#All original.

SHUT UP!
I can't\#hear the TV!
Food'll be\#out in just\#a second folks!\.\#HA HA!
So-
SHH!
Hold on,\#Fringe.
WHAT!
Now, I know you like\#your fun times...
...your quality time.\#I respect that.
But 'time' is what\#we're running out of.
As our eldest, you\#must equally be...
...the most\#righteous.
FINE!
I guess, I'll\#be the responsible\#adult around here.
Office Ottoman, roll\#call these bitches.
Sure...
Zein Ka:\#Robust Serpent.
Sss.
So, how's your\#glaucoma.
Ssso ssso.

Heh, why didn't you\#help Lester out?
I'm not that\#kind of shef.
Hilarious!

Tic Tonic:\#the astonishing\#Self-Detonating Man.
Jessie Mack:\#Head of the Mack Clan.
Tretcherousss Jessssie\#one with The Franchissse.
It's worse\#than I thought.
We've dealt\#with Jessie.
Once you've got the\#'eighty eight'- it's\#already too late.
Long Leg\#Lennie.
Present.
That's\#about it.
Finally!
Now then.
I know we all have\#things to complain\#about, always did.
Enough bad blood and\#old beef between\#us to fill a bovine\#lepper colony.
But never before have\#we faced a problem so\#large- it'd affect us all.
Get to\#the POINT!
Point is-\#our people\#are leaving.
It's worse-
Hah, he's got\#NO-ONE left.
I just don't\#understand.
I have three\#F's for you:
Franchise, Falsehoods\#and those Fuckin' posters.
Thisss isss the\#age of Sssicnesss.
Jerseyheads\#have no respect\#for 'the game'.
Fighting is what 'The Game'\#has always been about,\#but they take violence\#too seriously.
It's unsustainable.
Not just\#that...
...it's\#joyless.
Why do\#anything\#then!?
There is a small\#man, telling lies\#about big things...
...a different\#kind of life,\#a city, hope.
What HOPE are\#they talking\#about!? This\#show is disgusting.
Hm, more\#than one guy\#spreading more\#than one lie.
There is no girl and\#there is \C[18]NO CITY\C[0], there is\#nothing, but 'The Game'.
There might\#not even be\#that left.
Solutions?
Maybe you\#should all\#leave too.
What if he's right?
HAHA, right.
I need to make\#a phone call.
There are no\#phones downtown...
...we smashed them\#all, remember?
Okay,\| that's\#too much\#for me.
I'm going\#out for\#a smoke.
You guys...\|\#have fun.
For a moment this\#almost felt like a\#family dinner.
Haven't been\#to many.
Oh, me and\#my aunt used\#to have those\#all the time.
Big family.
Beth had loads\#of sisters.
We were\#all staying at\#her mother's.
She too\#had lots\#of sisters.
Were any of\#them hot?
He he he.
They were all\#so old, we were\#having funerals\#every other year.
A biennial\#holiday.
No school!\#Hell yeah!
Till none\#were left.
Do you ever\#miss them, Joel?
Women.
Have never\#seen "women".
Is always 'this'\#or 'that' woman.
Pretty things,\#some of them.
But what\#use is there\#in what was.
Time isn't\#what it was.
A single day like\#a thousand years.
And years\#somewhere\#else aren't even\#a moment.
If you go far\#enough, maybe\#you'll get back\#to 'what was'.
That's\#STUPID!
Everyone\#knows time\#is like a...
Sounds like you\#miss something\#you'd be used\#to losing.
It is never\#exactly\#the same.
You know...
... you two are\#fresh-smooth.
I think I want to\#come with you.
None of you are\#paying attention.
Nowhere to go,\#but INFINITY.
Shall we?
Let's.
It's all done!
My magnum opus...\.\#the Salt Souffle!
You guys\#are gonna\#love thi-\^
Oh, come on!
Can't go\#five minutes\#without people\#killin' each other...
They kept digging,\#but didn't know\#why! HA HA!
They can't\#pierce my\#shell. HA HA!
We found the robe.
Big deal, HA HA!
Didn't think you'd\#actually go after it though.
Tell you what:\|\#meet me at my\#burrow with a\#bunch of salt.
About fifteen\#chunks will do.
If you can do\#that, I'll make you\#a special treat! But\#only if! HA HA!
Hey, you found\#my other bathrobe!\#HA HA!
I'm not impressed though!
You won't find my\#other bathrobe!\#HA HA!
They didn't think\#I couldn't subsist\#on salt alone. HA HA!
What are\#you looking at?
You made\#your choice, pal!\.\#No backsies, HA HA!
The rest are torn to shreds.
This might be\#the worst place\#to be mortally\#wounded in.
Rattle. Rattle.
Corpse cart.
The woman glistens with an opaque substance.
You search the refrigerator.
Domestic Jerky and some Rotten Fruit!
Putrid kitchenware.
The Corps is\#all bark no bite.
Fringe knows\#how to show\#some teeth.
Bepe never\#did have\#any backbone.
Glad he\#finally shut\#that big\#mouth of his.
Can you\#believe\#this guy?
Just wait 'till\#the guys back\#at the Alley\#hear about this.
We're the\#best and\#we know it!
Angels ain't\#got shit\#on us!
...that's the\#best you could\#come up with?
Well at least I\#don't need glitter\#to know I'm golden.
OH YEAH!?
Well John Johnson\#could beat Fringe Boy!
That's it,\#I'm telling!
Is this\#going anywhere?
...You know what?
...Let's have\#him decide!
Yeah,\. yeah!\|\#An unbiased\#perspective!
Okay, guy!\.\#Who's better?
The Bad\#Angels or\#The Corps?
Bad Angels.
The Corps.
Don't rope me into this.
Uh...\| the\#Bad Angels?
Yes!
Once again\#I am on\#the right\#side of history!
Oh,\. I see\#how it is.
You think\#it's funny,\#playing with\#my emotions?!
Why don't\#I play with\#your FACE!
Please,\. have mercy!
Pffttt,\. someone's\#a sore loser!
You all are\#a bunch of\#cheating cowards!
I'm outta here!
What a chump.
Ha ha!
Is this the\#kind of support\#the Bad Angels\#are getting?
Pathetic,\. with\#a capital P!
Serves you right!
Talk smack,\.\#get smacked!
Uh...\| The Corps?
Well,\. what\#do you know!
Seems like\#this gentleman\#has some\#good sense!
You did\#NOT just\#say that!
I oughta\#wash your\#mouth out\#with soap!
But I don't\#have any soap...\|\#so I guess my\#fists will have to do!
Oh, the pain!
The awful\#pain of defeat!
Nice try,\#Tibby,\. but you\#can't change\#the truth!
I feel so\#humiliated...
My pride...\|\#it's been\#crushed!
Waaahhhh!
Bet he'll think\#twice before he\#opens his big\#mouth again.
Aw, what's wrong?
Too tough\#for ya?
This is why\#you don't screw\#with us Angels!
Pow!
Another crushed\#beneath the\#mighty heel\#of Dobs!
Don't rope\#me into this.
I don't\#even know\#what you're\#talking about.
Loser...
Salty Bathrobe!
At this rate I'll outdo\#Arnold himself.
It is shut from the other side.
You ever cut\#a rat open...
... put your\#pee pee in...
...have it live?
You remind\#me of that rat.
Talk to Maurice,\#he's my manager.
Climbing the folds\#is a tough grind...
...unless you've\#got a manager.
I don't need a manager.
Joel is my manager.
I don't need\#a manager.
You're just\#a vanilla\#killah, baby.
Joel is my\#manager.
I can't have him\#stealing talent.
The door is locked.
The door is blocked by something.
I feel like\#all the fire\#has gone out\#of my life.
Why did Zoltan\#have to leave\#me all alone?!
This stupid\#"Game" just\#isn't enough\#anymore.
I need\#something else.
This "city" everyone's\#talking about sounds\#way too perfect!
Can't imagine\#anything\#more boring.
I just want\#"The Game" back...
As long as TV man\#says it, some people'll\#believe it: drinking\#piss cures rabies.
Thank God that\#Kindchild switched\#frequencies!
Hey, that's\#my razor!
Thought I'd\#lost it for\#a good while...\|\#Hand it over!
He snatched away the mustache trimmer.
Uh,\. here.\.\#I'll throw\#you a bone.
Received a pack of liquor!
Knock yourself out.
Now,\. to\#trim this\#fuzz a little...
Empty. A slight draft can be felt around it.
You put out your hand. The draft is\#clearly coming from behind the crate.
Move the crate?
A secret was revealed!
Pillaged.
Pilfered.
Nothing left.
Well,\. well,\. well.
The thieving\#rats have come\#back to their den.
It was you\#rag men who\#took my secret\#stash,\. wasn't it?
We didn't know\#it was yours.
That doesn't matter.\|\#What matters is that you\#took what was mine.
I thought\#I told you\#roaches to stay\#out of our hair.
We're not\#just some\#common gang\#fucking around.
We are the\#God damn Rando Army,\.\#and that means we're\#above trashmen like you.
You oughta\#learn your place.
...Actually...
I think\#I'll put you\#there myself.
Jesus,\. what\#a freak.
You good, Alex?
Yeah.\. Mostly.
Cool, cool...
Say...
I saw\#you swipe a\#little blue pill\#off that guy's body.
I've seen\#these pills before.\.\#They can make you\#do terrible things.
He's tellin'\#the truth,\. Alex.
Once, I knew\#a guy who took\#a whole bunch\#of those pills.
And after\#he took them\#all,\. he blew up!
Well,\. that\#might've been\#because he\#drank gasoline...
Seriously,\. they're dangerous.
But I\#know a safe\#way to get\#rid of them.
So,\. uh...
Just toss it over.
Give Georgy the Joy?
Sure, I guess.\. Here.
Gave your Joy to Georgy.
Wise move.
Don't worry,\.\#I'll get rid\#of it nice\#and quick.
Hmm...\. no.\|\#I think I'll be fine.
Did you\#not just\#hear what\#I said?
That shit's bad!
A bad omen!
You're gonna be\#fucked if you keep\#it around for long.
Just give me\#the pill,\. Alex.
I can handle it.
Sorry, Georgy,\.\#but I'm not convinced\#that it's all that bad.
At the least,\.\#just holding onto it\#won't be any trouble.
I'll keep it\#on me until I know\#that it's actually-\^
You dumb motherfucker!
Give me the\#God damn Joy Alex!
No.\| I won't.
You son of a-!\^
Lay off, Georgy!
You're not\#making a very\#good case\#for yourself.
Keep it together,\.\#or we'll ditch you and\#find our own way off\#this rotten island.
You're...\. you're bluffing.
Try me.
God damn it,\. Alex...
You should've\#just given\#me the\#fucking pill.
Asshole.
Don't worry\#about it.\|\#This is just how\#Georgy gets sometimes.
Let's get\#outta here,\.\#'fore this cadaver\#starts stinking.
You should've\#known not\#to mess\#with our shit.
You good,\. Alex?
I saw\#you swipe\#a little blue pill\#off that guy's body.
Did you\#not just hear\#what I said?
You should've\#just given me\#the fucking pill.
It started\#raining like\#hell all of\#a sudden.
I got under\#this tree to\#stay dry, but...
I really\#didn't think\#this through.
Now I'm\#fucking\#moist.
MOIST!
Hey, who\#are you?
This camp is\#for Rando\#soldiers only.
I,\. uh,\.\#want to\#sign up.
For the Army.
...Huh.
Well, you\#couldn't have\#picked a worse\#time for that.
But whatever.
Go talk\#to our\#diplomat.
He's in\#the cave\#just below.
He'll\#get you\#"signed\#up."
If you came looking\#for big guns and\#cool armor, you\#won't find it here.
But hey,\#don't feel\#too bad.
Rando gear is\#notorious for its\#awful taint itch.
I can\#attest\#to that...
Everything was\#so advanced\#back then.
Did you know,\#with the way\#technology\#was heading...
...we would've\#had 4-D porno\#by 2005?
You're\#fucking\#with me.
Swear to\#God, man.
Stupid\#apocalypse...
Mags are\#just so\#primitive.
The car isn't getting fixed any time soon.
Life's a\#series of\#broken bridges...
Paths built\#and destroyed\#with little care\#for consequence.
Verily,\. this is\#the tragedy of\#the human\#condition.
Damn,\.\#I gotta piss.
I wonder\#how long\#I can hold\#it in...
Selections from an obscure newspaper.
The headline reads,\.\#"SOVIET TELEVISIONS:\#BRAINWASHING STATIONS?"
I remember\#when I was\#part of the\#Rando Brass.
Was a real\#kickass\#commando\#back then.
Without me,\#New Roads would\#still be filled with\#punk gangsters.
The horror of\#Russian Roulette\#would still plague\#the plains of Olathe!
Ah...\.\. but then\#they caught me\#stealing dirty pages\#from the top officers.
And that\#really didn't\#blow over well.
Miss\#those days.
When the rest of\#the Army returns,\#I'm gonna work my\#way back to the top.
I'll be sittin'\#with the head\#honchos again,\#just like old times.
They, uh,\.\#WILL come\#back, right?
Right?
This rain's\#fuckin' nuts.
Like God's\#taking a fat\#piss on our\#sorry asses.
Fuck\#you,\. God.
Eviscerated.
Rando supply truck. It appears to be broken down.
Rando supply truck. The engine has been replaced\#with a bag full of yellowing socks.
A Rando assault vehicle.\#The turret has been plugged with a cork.
Whew!\| Finally\#got outta there.
I got locked inside\#this tank,\. and when\#I screamed,\. no one\#came to help me out.
...Maybe we\#fortified the\#inside a\#little TOO well.
Well,\. now I\#have another problem.
I'm stuck\#in the hatch.
Great.\. Now I\#have TWO problems.
Stuck in the hatch\#AND getting rained on.
Geez.
Sitting duck.
A Rando assault vehicle.\#It's covered in rust and foliage.
A Rando assault vehicle.\#The exhaust port is leaking.
When the others\#left, they took\#all of our diesel.
Bitches.
How the\#hell are we\#gonna make\#firebombs now?
Oh, and drive\#our trucks\#too, I guess.
Maybe we\#could make\#our own fuel.
There's gotta\#be an oil well\#around here\#somewhere...
Hoo...\. ha...
I've been busy.
Where the fuck\#is the oil?!
It's just now\#occurring to me\#how high the\#groundwater is here.
Cock.
No more\#firebombs\#for us...
Trampled.
This\#is such\#bullshit...
I was\#on my\#way to a\#promotion.
One or two more\#missions and I would\#have been sitting\#with the big boys.
But then\#those fuckers\#left me to rot\#here in Trashland!
Uggggghhhhh!
I was\#gonna out\#-rank Clint\#Moss himself.
I was\#gonna be\#Rando's right\#hand man!
But no!\.\#No luck\#for ol' Buck!
...It's all because\#I tripped at the high\#school talent show...
Vanessa,\#my beloved...
Fuckin' Chriss,\.\#stealing her\#away from me!
The water in the well has a muddy texture.
Toss in a Rando Coin and make a wish?
Name the object of your desire.
Something shot out from the well!
Got 5 Rotten Fruit!
Got a magazine!
Got a Meat Nugget!
Got Muck Rum!
Nothing happened.
It gave you back your Rando Coin!
Got a Muddy Cloth!
Got a Cigarette Butt!
Got a Diet Cocola Cola!
A mud-stained note shot out from the well.
It reads:
"You're conceited."
Luck decreased.
Aw, Lucky.
You don't\#gotta wish\#for me.
I'm still\#here,\. aren't I?
Got 2 Mud Pies!
Got some Bird Feed!
You got your Rando Coin back!
The well is full of blood.
As punishment\#for my crimes against\#the Rando Army, I was\#given an ultimatum.
Fix this\#junker,\. or\#get tossed\#in the drink.
But I'm not\#a mechanic!
I took one\#welding course\#back in college!
And I don't\#even have\#a toolbox...
Tits.
What did\#you even do\#to deserve\#this punishment?
I did lines\#of Joy powder\#on the hood\#of Rando's car.
Just kidding.
They caught\#me hoarding\#perfume in\#my quarters.
Damn Clint\#Moss has a\#nose like a\#bloodhound...
One hour in,\#and I have yet\#to make any\#sort of headway.
Without tools,\.\#what can\#I even do?
God,\#I'm so\#screwed...
We found\#something\#that might\#interest you.
Wait...\.\#is that?
A wrench?
Can...\.\. can\#I have it?
It's yours.
I just wanted to show you.
Here,\#it's yours.
Oh, thank God.
You gave away the monkey wrench.
You might\#have just\#saved my life.
And for that,\#how about something\#that could save yours?
He gave you some Fancy Perfume!
This is\#the one\#bottle they\#never found...
Don't let\#it go to\#waste.
I just\#thought\#you'd like\#to see it.
Now I can\#finally get\#something done.
Turn\#some...\.\#screws\#and shit.
I think\#this rain\#is a sign.
A sign for\#me to give up,\.\#'cause this is\#never getting done.
Guess I\#better start\#learning\#how to swim.
I'm about to\#be up shit creek\#without a paddle.
Oh,\. come on!
I was actually\#starting to get\#somewhere.
Now this\#damn rain's\#gonna rust\#the whole car.
Just couldn't\#let me have\#this one,\. eh...?
I fucking\#hate nature.
This sucks\#so hard.
I joined the Army\#so I could shoot\#huge guns, not sit\#around and eat trash.
They didn't\#even give\#me a gun...
I feel\#so empty...
Like an\#old soda can...
Don't worry,\.\#I'm not gonna\#hurt myself.
The spear\#is dull anyway.
As if my\#week hasn't\#been shat on\#enough already.
Now it's\#literally raining\#on my parade.
I should have\#joined the Banana\#Splitz when I\#had the chance.
Speared through the head.
My job is\#to stand here\#and look badass.
Any questions?
I'm actually\#pretty softhearted.
Used to donate\#to that Garbage\#Insanity fund\#back in the '80s.
I think\#this spot\#suits me\#much more.
Makes me\#feel all "high\#and mighty."
I'm like\#a cliff.
Rocky in\#some places,\#but smooth\#in others.
Staked.
Come\#in, Rando.
This is\#Officer Ashe\#speaking.
I repeat, this\#is Officer Ashe,\.\#Garbage Island.
...Hello?\.\.\#Come in,\#Rando!
Come in!
...Damn it...
Lost\#them\#again.
I've been\#trying to contact\#the rest of the\#Army for hours.
To get\#some\#answers.
But so\#far,\. no dice.
...I wonder\#if they've\#just given\#up on us...
There's been\#nothing but static\#ever since my\#last transmission.
Not a\#peep from\#high command.
They really\#have left us\#to rot here...
And now that\#Will Killjoy's been\#let off his chain.
Take my\#advice, brother.
Stay away\#from that guy.
It's hopeless...
The rain is\#going to short-\#circuit the radio.
And after\#that, we\#really will be\#off the grid...
I just\#want to\#know...
Why did\#they leave\#us behind...?
Slaughtered.
Jerry-rigged radio.\#It's a miracle that it even works.
Oh, Sean...
Wherever\#have you\#gone...?
Who's Sean?
My grandson.
He and a few\#other soldiers were\#sent out to scout\#the orange cliffs, but...
Well,\. they've\#yet to return.
It's been\#days now.
And I\#fear the\#worst has\#happened...
Reveal Sean's fate?
We\#know what\#happened\#to Sean.
R-really?
We found\#him in a\#cave, and he...
...well, he\#was already\#gone by then.
.\..\..\.I see.
So,\. the\#worst has\#come to pass.
I can't...\.\#say this\#was unexpected.
Erm, this\#may be a\#strange\#request, but...
...could you\#bring me\#his body?
If he\#truly\#is gone...
Then he surely\#does not deserve\#to rot away\#in some cave.
We have\#Sean's body.
Lost Sean's corpse.
...My poor boy.
To think,\#you would\#perish\#before me.
Such a\#tragedy.
Thank\#you, sir.
You have\#brought\#closure to\#this old man.
It's the\#least I\#could do.
Anything to\#ease the\#pain of\#your loss.
Words cannot\#express how\#much I appreciate\#your efforts.
But,\. perhaps\#this can\#speak for me.
Got a Skeleton Key!
This key\#goes to our\#storehouse in\#the cliffs.
It was probably\#cleared out when\#the rest of the\#Army left, but...
...I'm sure\#you'll be able\#to find something\#of worth in there.
But I\#wanted to.
Now, this\#grandfather will\#mourn the loss\#of his kin.
We'll see\#what we\#can do.
You\#have my\#sincerest\#thanks.
We've sent out\#search teams, but\#they've all come\#back empty-handed.
He must have\#fallen somewhere\#far out of sight.
My poor boy...
He must\#be so\#afraid...
Were you\#able to retrieve\#my Sean's body?
Not yet.
Take\#your\#time.
I gave\#him a\#proper\#burial.
May he\#rest easy.
I don't\#like these\#winds, friend.
They carry\#with them\#an aura\#most sordid.
Please, let\#the rain not\#wash away\#his grave.
End of the line.
I'm so\#stressed\#out, man.
First, the other guys\#ditch us,\. and then I find\#out they took all of our\#extra rations with them...
It's been\#a bad day.
I just\#need to\#try and\#relax.
Unwind\#a bit.
Well, what\#do you normally\#do to unwind?
Eat.
Pretty sure\#the storehouse\#had some rations...
I'm starving...
And the garbage\#around here is starting\#to look appetizing, too...
Hold it\#together,\. Dick...
*sniff*\.\. *sniff*
Hey!\. You've\#got something\#tasty in your pockets!
It smells\#like a...\.\.\#*sniiiiiifffffffff*\.\.\.\#like a ration!
P-please, let\#me have it!
I'm about\#to go mad\#from hunger!
Give him the ration.
Hog it.
Yes...\. yes!
Hand it\#over already!
He snatched your ration and scarfed it down.
Ahhhh...\.\. that's\#what the\#doctor ordered.
Well, aside\#from the\#heartache\#medicine...
But I digress.
You're a\#life-saver, dude.
Here.\. For\#the trouble.
He gave you some kind of toy.
That's a\#limited-edition\#Rando bobblehead.
So rare,\.\#only one\#even exists!
No idea\#what it was\#doing in my\#Wally meal...
But it's\#yours now.
Take good\#care of it,\#alright?
I need\#food too,\#you know.
Man...\. at\#this rate, I'm\#gonna be skin\#and bones!
I'll do\#anything!\.\#Just let\#me have it!
Still no.
Uh oh...
I think\#I have a\#stomachache.
Don't\#think\#I can't\#smell you.
Trashman.
What're you\#doing here?
I came\#to sign up.
To join\#the Army.
Spare me\#the bullshit.
No one in their right\#mind would just waltz\#into a Rando Camp and\#ask to be made a soldier.
Especially\#not at a\#time like this.
No...\.\. I\#know why\#you're here.
You want to corrupt\#what's left of our\#force with your trashy,\.\#disgusting self,\.\. don't you?!
That's absurd.
I'm not\#like these\#people.
You sure\#look like them.
Sure\#SMELL\#like them.
But I'm\#not LIKE them.
Stop\#lying\#to my\#face.
I've seen you\#raw-dogging\#trashbags like a\#fucking animal.
You fit\#RIGHT in.
Maybe so.
But I've\#seen you\#out there.
Mingling with\#these trashfolk.
Sooner or later\#you'll be all\#but comfortable\#with this place.
And when\#that happens,\#you'll be right\#at home here.
Either way...
You don't\#belong in\#this camp.
So get the\#hell out,\. or\#we're gonna\#have problems.
Am I\#clear?
.\..\..\.Yes.
Leave,\#before\#things\#get ugly.
And don't\#go near\#Floyd,\. or\#you're dead.
He's staring off at the distant cliffs.
Bad idea.
Man, I\#miss porn\#flicks.
Mags get the job\#done, but there was\#nothin' quite like\#some full-motion melons.
Ya feel me?
I know\#what you\#mean, dude.
Tragic loss.
Wonder how much\#a real, working\#porn tape would\#fetch nowadays...
Small grave.
I decided to\#stand in a\#different spot.
I hope no\#one minds.
Do you\#like the skull?
It's a\#real one.
Yep, straight\#from the\#catacombs\#of France.
Don't ask me\#what I was doing\#in the catacombs\#of France.
Harold asked\#me to trade\#places again.
I don't\#mind.
I can\#stand\#anywhere.
Do you\#still have\#to-\^
You\#know it.
But you're\#not going to.
Youuuu\#know it.
This will\#be my\#life's\#work.
The ultimate\#piss victory.
Piss-tory.
Eternal relief.
I swear, sometimes\#I see these...\.\.\#freaky fuckin' fish\#things in the water.
I'm not\#shitting you!\.\#Fishmen are real!
I wish\#I was\#a fishman...
Better than\#being a\#Rando man.
We are\#so fucked\#if a hurricane's\#coming our way.
Maybe I could try\#to catch the wind\#with a bag and sail\#off this big crap heap...
Nah, that\#sounds\#ridiculous.
It's not as\#unrealistic\#as it sounds.
I hate\#storms.
Lightning\#freaks\#me out.
Hey!\. I thought\#I told you\#to stay still-\.\^
...No way...
NO WAY!
A real,\.\#live fishman!
I knew\#they existed!
I knew\#I wasn't\#insane!
Fuck\#you, mom!
Fuck you,\#therapy!
Wait,\. does\#this mean...?
Yes...\.\. I\#think\#it does!
Somewhere below\#this hellhole island\#lies a fishy paradise!
And it's\#calling\#my name!
This is\#the break\#I've been\#waiting for!
Goodbye,\.\#Rando Army!
And hello,\.\#Fish Heaven!
Back in\#the pocket,\.\#young man.
Bullet sponge.
I've still\#gotta piss.
But I'm\#gonna\#hold it in.
Wanna go\#for the\#world\#record.
The record...\.\#for how long\#a man can hold\#his peepee in.
This will be\#the ultimate\#test of strength\#for my bladder...
Nothing like\#a shower to\#go along with\#this bath, eh?
Takes my\#mind off\#food for\#a change.
How\#did you-\^
Get\#up here?
I'm not\#entirely\#sure myself.
Mulched.
"WANTED: Bolo Bugaughtiichi, rogue gang leader."
"WANTED: Slim Hartmann, Joy dealer."
It looks restless.
It's pecking at the bars.
The cage looks weak.
It broke out.
"Notice from High Command:
"It has come to our attention that\#there has been a rise in Joy usage\#throughout the Rando Army as of late.
"As such, we will reiterate that the usage,\#possession, and trade of Joy is strictly\#forbidden among soldiers and officials alike.
"Anyone caught committing any of\#the prior offenses will face expulsion\#and possible execution, depending on\#the magnitude of their crimes.
"Report any and all activity\#to your respective officers.

Empty seat.
The crate is unguarded.
Peek inside?
The\#crate.
Did you\#open it?
We found\#it like this.
Close it.
I said...
Close\#the crate.
Now leave.
And do\#not return.
Say\#no more.
The crate is empty.
Heavy machine gun.
The gun is gone.
Come no\#closer,\. rags.
This area\#is off-limits.
If I\#may ask,\.\#why's that?
Rando's\#orders.
No one\#is to come\#near this crate.
Is there\#something\#dangerous\#inside it?
Maybe,\.\#maybe not.
I didn't\#question it.
Perhaps\#you could\#stand to\#do the same.
Still\#here?
Do not\#test my\#patience.
Would you\#happen to\#be Floyd?
Who told\#my name?
A guy\#outside.
Tall, dragging\#around some\#kind of chain.
Sound\#familiar?
Hmph.\.\.\#That's Will.
Are you two\#acquainted?
Used\#to be.
Not so\#much\#anymore.
Why?\. What\#happened?
...Sorry.\.\.\#I don't\#mean\#to pry.
When society\#collapsed, Will\#started making...\.\#questionable\.\. choices.
We started\#to squabble,\.\#and then fight.
Eventually\#we just stopped\#talking altogether.
And you\#still joined\#the Army\#together?
Correct.
Rando needed\#muscle, and we\#needed something\#to do with ourselves.
I hoped\#it could help\#us move past\#some things,\. but...
Well, you\#can piece\#together\#the rest.
Sorry that\#happened.
Save\#your\#pity.
I have\#left the\#past behind.
Now it\#is the\#future I\#worry for.
It looks\#like Will left.
What?\. You\#mean, left\#the camp?
Peculiar.
I thought he\#had already\#killed them all...
Huh?\.\#Killed\#who?
That is\#none of\#your concern.
Just know that\#if you see him,\.\#you should stay\#out of his way.
He hates\#this island.
Will...
What are\#you doing...?
Got a Rando Mask.
Two Rando Rations!
There's something at the bottom of the crate.
Got a monkey wrench!
Cleared out.
Someone else's grave.
"Harry Sweets\#1945-19..."
The rest is illegible.
That's my\#pappy's grave.
He was a real\#fun guy, he was.
He's long gone\#now,\. but when\#he was around,\#whew-wee...
Those were\#some good,\.\#good memories.
You wanna\#hear a few?
Sure, go on.
I'll pass.
Well,\. it\#all started\#that day\#in the park...
I'll pass.\.\#We should\#probably\#get going.
It still\#hurts, you know.
I miss\#you,\. pap.
I want\#nothing to\#do with that\#red skull.
Rando is\#the scum\#of the Earth.
Believe it or not,\#there was a time\#before the trash\#took over this island.
Back then, the\#water was clear,\#and fresh fruit\#grew from the trees...
It was\#peaceful,\#and we\#were happy.
That's all\#gone now.
What happened to\#this place was tragic,\#but I suppose all\#things die someday.
I would\#know.\. I used\#to dig graves\#for a living.
It's hard to\#live when all\#you know is death.
Those Rando\#hooligans have\#no respect\#for the dead.
Honestly,\. just\#dumping\#corpses on\#the ground...
At least the\#garbage folks have\#a tradition, rancid\#as it may be.
I don't like\#the way the\#wind blows\#these days.
Something\#terrible is\#coming\#this way...
Perhaps it's\#time to finally\#move on from\#this sinking ship.
I think\#that's a\#good idea.
We're setting\#sail for the\#mainland\#very soon.
It's an\#enticing\#prospect.
Unfortunately,\.\#I don't think\#I'll be able to\#go through with it.
This island still\#holds one particularly\#tight bond to me.
My shovel.\.\#The one I\#buried so\#many with.
It's still\#out there.
I can't\#bring myself to\#leave without it.
Do you\#know where\#it could be?
It's probably\#rotting away\#in my old\#hometown.
That place\#lies far\#below\#the cliffs.
Trying to get\#down there would\#be suicide for a\#man of my age.
I'll see if\#I can find it.
...Thank you.
I found\#a shovel.
Is this\#what you're\#looking for?
...Yes, actually.
I would\#recognize this\#spade anywhere.
You gave back the shovel.
...Well.
There's\#nothing\#holding me\#back anymore.
So I suppose...\.\#I can finallly\#say "goodbye."
Stay safe\#out there,\#brother.
We'll find\#our paradise\#one of these days.
I trust you\#won't go poking\#around any more\#graveyards,\. yes?
No promises.
Anything to report?
It's written in a foreign language.
I've no\#use for\#money.
In the\#next life,\#it won't\#matter.
Ol' Samuel\#can't seem\#to let go\#of the past.
Can't say I\#blame him.\. What\#happened to this\#island was tragic.
The tombstones\#are all that\#we have left.
The last\#remnants\#of what\#used to be.
This island\#sinks lower\#every day.
Eventually, it's\#going to be\#swallowed up\#by the sea.
It's all\#Gerald's fault.
Finally left,\.\#eh, Sam?
I know\#how much\#it hurts.
One day,\#I hope that\#I can follow in\#your footsteps.
A grave, of sorts.
It still hurts.
Jesus\#Christ...
Never knew\#those two\#had it in them...
It's a\#bloody\#slaughter...
We were\#workin'\#on a li'l\#project.
Rando wanted\#us to make some\#tunnels underneath\#Garbage Island.
In case of\#emergency,\.\#I suppose.
We were\#makin' good\#progress...
...but then a\#pair of blokes\#went off the\#deep end.
And now all\#the miners've\#been ripped a\#new arsehole.
We took\#care of\#those guys.
Oh,\#aces,\.\#mate!
Well, guess\#I'll go and\#assess the\#damages.
Here,\. for\#your help.
Received a magazine!
Where are\#those guys?
In our\#camp just\#down below.
Don't get\#yourself hurt...
If those\#goons don't\#clear out soon...
I might\#have to\#try and\#make them...
We took\#care of the\#crazy guys.
This place\#ain't half bad...
Nice and\#moist, as all\#good things are.
Can never tell\#what them Randos'll\#get up to when\#ya ain't watchin'.
Might make\#this my home\#away from home.
Not that\#I have\#a home...
A map of Garbage Island. It's covered with notes\#related to some kind of tunnel system.
Oh,\. thank\#fuckin' God.
They must've\#bashed each\#other's brains in\#while I was gone.
And to think, I was\#ready to chuck this here\#dynamite right at 'em!
Glad that\#wasn't necessary...
...not that I DON'T\#have confidence in my\#demolition expertise...
Sheesh.
You really\#did a number\#on them, eh?
I wish\#I knew\#what got\#into them.
Maybe that whole\#"Garbage Insanity"\#business from back\#when was real after all.
Either way,\#the tunnels're\#never gonna\#get done now.
I hope\#Rando\#doesn't\#mind...
I'd say he's\#concerned\#with other\#things now.
Now,\#the one\#question\#remains...
What am\#I gonna do\#with all\#this TNT?
Busted TV.
This is my\#cave, and by\#extension,\#my home.
You're...\.\#kinda trespassing.
That's a nice\#way for me\#to tell you to\#get out of here.
Shelter, at least in theory.
Alien text. It's impossible\#to discern its meaning.
It appears to be some kind of warning.
More text. Perhaps it spells out a name?
It's fixated on your Rando Coin.
Chew before\#you swallow.
You tossed the Rando Coin into its mouth.
It seemed to like it!
It's having trouble breathing.
It looks sated.
Its labored breathing has doubled in pace.
Something is strange about\#this particular patch of grass.
Investigate further?
Where the\#hell have\#you landed\#us now,\. Alex?
What are\#they,\. Joel?
Look like\#fish to me.
Fish with legs.
Hey, I've\#heard of\#these things!
They're both\#fish and\#men...\.\.\#fishmen.
Real clever name.
Think they're dangerous?
Could be.\.\#Best not let\#your guard\#down, Lucky.
It nearly knocked itself out.
The stentch of fish is far too strong.
You fail to capture its attention.
It's staring off.
It's disturbed by the silence.
It's questioning your intentions.
It's thinking about something.
It's oblivious to what's happened.
It doesn't care.
It's dripping with paint.
It doesn't want to be near you.
It's staring at you ominously.
It's gazing quizzically.
Waterlogged boombox. It seems to be\#the source of the music filling the cavern.
Take the cassette tape inside?
Got a weird cassette!
They're looking at you with hostility.
Put the tape back?
The Elder is assessing the situation.
It's too late to put it back.
Infant fishman. It looks excited just to see you.
It has a loving look in its eyes.
Take the Baby Fishman?
The Baby Fishman hopped into your pocket!
Alex can now use the Spout skill!
It looks saddened.
It's nudging at your leg.
A menacing aura emanates from this tent.
It looks confused.
It looks surprised to see you.
It's scared of you.
Its attention is caught,\. but quickly lost.
It's the painter's child.
It's too young to understand your actions.
It's relaxing.
It's been disturbed.
It doesn't want your money.
It's too cool to play by the rules.
It's giving you a stone cold stare.
It doesn't seem interested.
It's some kind of trading post.
You can't tell WHAT it's trading, however.
The trader seems attracted\#to your green glob.
Hand it over?
Give the glob.
Keep the slime.
You lost the glob.
It gave you something in return!
Got a mannequin torso!
It smells putrid...
It's satisfied with your trade.
It doesn't look open for business.
It looks betrayed.
BEING WET:
It never hurts to\#take a dip every once\#in a while, but being\#soggy has its drawbacks.
Your clothes will\#get heavy, weighing you\#down until they dry.
Plus, you become\#a target for some\#seriously sick shockage.
If you're damp and hear\#some crackling nearby,\#do yourself a favor and\#get the heck outta there!
You don't wanna be\#in the water when\#a toaster falls in!\#-Wet 'n' Wild Terry
This note is in English. It reads:
"Motherfucking fish things, so\#God damn sick of this smell.
"How do I get out?! I am\#just trapped here for the\#rest of my miserable life?!
"Trapped in fish hell?!
"There's gotta be a way out...\#something I've glossed over...
"I've been hearing wind blowing\#from behind the grass...\#gotta check it out, and soon."
Don't\#judge\#me, man.
This is\#where I was\#meant to be...
Live your\#life on the\#surface.
As I will\#live mine\#down below.
Rando ain't\#it, mahn.
He don't\#respect da\#trashy life.
...Yep.
Dis is\#da life.
Larry D.\#changed\#mah mind, yo.
Opened mah eyes.
Opened mah nose.
Smell dat\#trash, son.
If Darry's\#hangin' witchu,\.\#dat must mean\#ya's special, son.
Take care o'\#him for meh.
Somethin' made\#Darry real upset.
Ain't nevah seen\#him so blue.
Ah, rest\#his soul.
You got\#da good,\#good smell.
Anotha man\#enterin' da\#land o' honey.
Dere's still time.
You can change\#ya mind, son.
Please...\.\#we nevah\#get any\#new friends.
Why did\#Toady have\#to leave meh...
It looks calm.
Aww.
You like\#cats, Joel?
Always did have\#a soft spot for the\#little furballs.
Used to make\#a livin' drawin'\#them on postcards\#and what have you.
Now that I\#say that out\#loud, it sounds\#pretty weird, huh?
No, that sounds adorable.
It is a little strange.
No way, that\#sounds adorable.
You think so?
You should\#consider picking\#art back up again.
You\#know\#what?
Might just\#consider\#it now, Lucky.
Nothing to\#be ashamed\#of, though.
I guess.
Too bad no\#one appreciates\#art these days.
'Less it's\#of the\.\#"adult"\.\#variety.
I don't\#need your\#money.
Can't you\#see I'm trying\#to die here?
They say the\#way to live a\#trashy life is to\#die a trashy death.
So\#how come\#I'm not\#fucking dying?!
I didn't even\#poke holes\#in this bag!
I should've\#just jumped\#off a cliff.
Woulda been\#way easier.
But now\#I've gotta\#commit\#to this.
It's been\#thirty-eight hours.
Still alive.
I can't tell if\#I'm the world's\#luckiest or un-\#luckiest person.
Ew. No\#thanks.
What I wouldn't\#give to be personally\#greased up by a\#beautiful trash angel...
*sniff*\.\#*sniiiiiiffffffff*
You smell good.
I haven't\#bathed in months.
I know.\#Your greasy\#aroma is\#pleasing to me.
Come on,\#take the\#compliment.
Hey, Darry.\#Make some\#new friends?
You betcha!\#They gave\#me a\#gummy worm.
Sick, dude.
These guys\#are keepers\#for sure.
Darry's the\#biggest party\#animal I've\#ever known.
You're in for\#a fun time.
One way\#or another.
That's\.\#THE\. stentch.
Your eyes\#have been\#opened,\#haven't they?
My sinuses\#are on fire.
You bet\#they are.
Welcome to\#the good life,\#my brother.
We'll treat\#you right.
Don't talk\#to me.
He seems busy.
He passed out.
Do not defile\#our paradise with\#that foul symbol.
I am\#become Trash,\.\#destroyer\#of worlds.
Body of\#man, mind\#of garbage.
This is\#ascension.
You\#are ready.
The\#metamorphosis\#is nearly\#complete.
Heretic.
Begone from\#my sight.
This is\#a paradise\#for us men\#of garbage.
So many\#bags in\#one place...
It doesn't\#even matter\#what's inside.
The plastic\#speaks for itself.
This is\#my cocoon.
One day I\#will emerge\#a beautiful\#trash butterfly...
Mysterious and lovely.
It's been blocked.
You have lost the Versace Bag Balloon.
...I need\#to leave.
Now.
...Small trash is spilling out of the lock...
It's been locked tight.
It reminds you of days gone.
This car seems cartoonishly large.
Somehow, it feels as if you've seen it before.
You checked the cabinet.
Found some mystery jerky!
"Vote Gerald!"
No...\. not again...
Old poster. The text is unreadable.
Torn poster. The text is illegible.
A relatively intact poster. It seems to be centered\#around raising voter awareness.
Another poster. It stresses the importance\#of local government.
Yet another poster. It advocates for voters to\#remain informed about candidates and their policies.
Shredded poster. It says something about\#election fraud.
A timetable for meetings,\#among various other papers.
You searched the desk drawer.
A small key!
"Note to self: as the secretary for Mayor Gerald,\#it's my responsibility to make sure we're prepared\#for everything, even the most dire circumstances."
"Just in case something weird happens, there are\#spare keys to both the back door and to Mayor\#Gerald's personal quarters."
"Spare key for the back door is in my desk. The key\#to Gerald's office will be in my house, but I won't\#say anything more than that."
"This is important information! Don't forget it!\#- Secretary Scourge"
Propaganda poster. It reads "Vote Gerald for mayor!"
It won't budge. The keyhole is rather large.
You used the Large Key.
It's long since made its last call.
Found a cigarette!
Won't move. The keyhole is rather small.
You used the Small Key.
Propaganda poster. It's partially torn up.
Vandalized propaganda poster.
A rotund posterior was drawn over the poster.
Someone's insane political ramblings. The name\#"Gerald" appears multiple times.
Nothing to eat.
"Ever since Mayor Gerald took office, pollution\#rates across the island have skyrocketed.\#This is in spite of the mayor's promises to\#reduce said numbers."
You checked under the bed.
A large key!
Something is written on\#the back of this poster.
Take it down?
Got the poster!
The filing cabinet is marked with a star.
Open a drawer?
Close the open drawer?
The drawer is stuck in place.
The filing cabinet is marked with a club.
The filing cabinet is marked with a spade.
The filing cabinet is marked with a heart.
A secret path was revealed!
The text is illegible.
We should've\#never come to\#this shithole island.
The people here\#are too busy sticking\#their dicks in trash to\#give us their time.
Now look at\#what's happened...
Poor T.P.
Can't wait to\#go back to shore.
Slim's prolly wondering\#where the hell we are.
It's full of blue pills.
Hands off\#the merchandise!
That shit ain't\#for free, ya know!
The box is empty.
Ahhh!\. We've\#been found out!
He isn't breathing.
If you came for\#T.P., then you're gonna\#have to go through me!
I'm not looking\#for a fight.
I'm looking\#for a way\#out of here.
Sorry, can't\#help you\#with that.
We're a bit\#lost ourselves.
Had to come\#down to this\#shit pit to get\#outta trouble.
A bigass Rando\#bastard stormed our\#old hideout and fucked\#up our friend T.P.
He's probably\#not gonna make it.
Big Rando soldier?\|\#Did he have\#a chainlink whip?
Yep, that's him.
Absolute animal,\.\#and that's coming from me.
You should probably\#get out of here.
We're planning on it.
As soon as\#the coast is clear, we're\#making a break for\#the mainland.
A friend is\#gonna meet us there.
Well, good luck.
I'm not allowed to\#give away the good stuff,\.\#so take this instead.
He gave you a bottle of soup!
Happy trails.
Remember to\#stay joyful.
None of the\#islanders care much\#for our stuff.
Except for this\#one fat guy.
Slim says he'll\#always come back.
How did you find\#this place,\. anyway?
The attic's\#hidden behind\#a weird mechanism.
I found a poster.
Figured it\#out from there.
Fuck, I knew\#I shouldn't have\#left that out.
Uhhh...\| here.\.\#Let's trade.
That poster\#for this mag.
He snatched the poster...
...but gave you a mag in return!
I really need\#to memorize that code.
Lest someone else\#stumble upon this place.
Someone a lot\#more violent than you.
Glad you\#were the one\#to find that\#thing, instead of...
Well,\. a more\#unsavory character.
"Vote Gerald! Vote now!"
"Gerald for mayor!"
The desk's surface is coated with a layer of dust.
Something shimmers from underneath it.
"Mayor Gerald's approval ratings sink as\#the island itself begins to descend into garbage."
Rusted shut.
"Mayor Gerald receives major criticism\#after the failed implementation of his\#pollution reduction programs."
"Mayor Gerald goes silent as protesters rally\#outside the town hall."
"Pollution rates soar across the island.\#Heaps of trash have coalesced along the\#shorelines, threatening to push onto land..."
"...these recent developments are blamed\#on the inaction of the island's mayor,\#Gerald von Buckingham."
"Mayor Gerald's new policies on pollution have been\#deemed 'highly inadequate' by climate scholars."
There's something odd\#about this particular cabinet.
Upon a closer look,\#the cabinet is purely decorational.
I need time.\.\.\#Time to think.
Think about\#everything.
Oh,\.\. a\#visitor.
Haven't seen hide nor\#hair of nobody 'round\#this town in a long time.
What brings\#you here, kid?
I fell\#down the cliff.
Been looking\#for a way back\#to the topside.
If an exit's\#what ya need,\#the hole behind\#me'll do nicely.
Should lead\#right back up\#the mountain.
Say,\. who's\#that guy?
His face is\#everywhere\#down here.
Him?
Why, that's none\#other than the lowliest,\.\#most back-stabbingest\#bastard in Olathe.
Mayor Gerald\#von Buckingham.
He promised\#us so much.
In the end,\.\#it was all\#garbage.
Took us 'till we\#were up to our knees\#in trash 'fore we\#figured that out.
By then,\.\#he'd already\#hightailed it\#outta here.
An' left us\#with that no-\#good son of his.
Yellow-bellied\#pussies, the\#both of 'em.
If you don't\#like it here,\.\#why not leave?
Trust me,\.\#they left.
They all did.
'Cept me.
I'm awful\#sentimental\#like that.
Couldn't stand\#to leave this\#shitheap behind.
Not when\#it's the only\#home I knew.
So I stayed,\. and hoped\#and prayed every day\#that things would just go\#back to how they used to be.
That day\#never came.
It's not\#too late.
You could\#still-\^
Shush\#up,\. boy.
You don't know\#what it's like to see\#everything you ever\#worked for go up in filth.
It's a\#terrible\#feelin'.
Makes your\#head all woozy,\.\#makes ya wanna\#lose your lunch.
And over these long\#years I've realized that\#nothin' ain't never gonna\#be how it was again.
So that's\#why I'm here.\.\.\#Sittin' in silence\#'til the day I die.
And, boy...
You're makin'\#an awful\#lotta noise.
Hey, stop!
I don't\#want to\#fight you.
Neither of\#us needs that.
Shouldn't\#have gotten all\#ornery like that.
It's just been\#so long since...\.\.\#well, anything\#happened to me.
'Fore you came in,\#I can't tell you the\#last time I seen\#another livin' soul.
I been stewin' here\#in this cave so many\#years, I feel like I'm\#half the man I once was.
Just an angry\#shell of the old\#Gunther Scourge.
It's okay.
Things might\#not be the\#way they\#used to.
But we're not\#all dead yet.
Even at our\#ages,\. there's still\#a life to be lived.
We just\#have to\#find it.
But what if\#I can't find\#anything\#out there?
What'll\#happen then?
I suppose you'll\#cross that bridge\#when you come to it.
But you'll\#never get there\#unless you take\#that first step.
Empty chair.
Son, if there's one\#thing I've learned during\#my time on this Earth...
...it's that there's\#always one thing you can\#do when you're in a\#sticky situation.
What's that, pap?
You can always\#get down and dirty.
Hoo!
Haa!
Come on, son!\#Shake a leg with\#your old man!
A tombstone. The text is illegible.
The stone is partially eroded.
The stone is completely eroded.
A tombstone. The name "Cherie von Buckingham"\#is the only legible part of the epitaph.
There used to be writing on this cross,\#but it was later scraped off.
An old shovel is sticking up from the dirt.
Take it?
Got a rusty spade!
Warning: Floor unstable! Fall at your own risk.
It's busy.
Dried herb!
Oh, a visitor?
How unusual.
Welcome,\. stranger.\.\#I am Deocletians, and you\#now stand before the\#Land with No Sun.
It's a mystical place,\#the home of our\#brothers and forefathers.
Enjoy your stay,\#but be mindful\#of our customs.
We are a proud people.
They call us\#"Marauders,"\. but we\#only take what we need.
Not that I would\#expect any of the\#lowlifes in these wastes\#to understand that.
Our legacy goes\#back further than even\#the world's end.
We've a lengthy history\#of mysticism and medicine\#here in our homeland.
And yet,\. we're\#treated like common\#thieves by so many.
Such a shame.
The Cliff of Perpetuality\#is one of the greatest\#mysteries known to man.
Those that it\#deems worthy are\#known to return from\#the depths with strange powers.
It is said that\#there exists an artifact\#in these wastes that can\#somehow appease the cliff.
But none know\#of its location.
Perhaps you will\#be responsible for\#its discovery.
Doom.\| That is\#all I can see\#ahead of us.
Ciosmorosin has\#sent our entire village\#out to die.
My heart is heavy,\#but I cannot cry.\|\#Not while there is even\#a sliver of hope left.
Outsider, if you\#see them again...
...tell them to\#abandon their quest\#and return to the village.
If they don't...
They will die.
I'll keep it in mind.
Beware,\#outsider.
Violate our\#laws and your\#punishment\#will be swift.
We aren't here\#to cause trouble.
That's what\#they all say.
Do not\#be fooled,\.\#man of rags.
We may\#appear docile,\.\#but our sheathes\#hide deadly blades.
We live in peace\#knowing that all who\#wrong us will be struck\#down without mercy.
This world is not\#what it used to be.
The flow of\#space and time\#is contorted,\.\#twisted like a snake.
Life is quick to\#be snuffed,\. replaced\#with looming demise.
But life cannot\#be completely destroyed.
When a soul is\#taken from one,\. it is\#soon moved to another.
Now, even the\#shadows themselves\#have been granted\#the gift of life.
Our goal\#is to\#discover the\#cosmic truth.
For what reason\#does the universe itself\#now spiral out of control?
The elder\#will know\#in due time.
The elder\#has spoken.
I pray for\#the safety of\#my brothers.
The\#shadows...
He's muttering to himself.
Looming monument.
Welcome to\#our village,\. stranger.
It must surely\#be a refresher to\#see a civilized place\#in this day and age.
It does seem nice,\.\#but I don't know just\#how\. "civilized"\. a place\#can be anymore.
Very true, friend.\.\#Very true.
We are\#peaceful, however,\.\#so long as\#you are in kind.
Well, I'm no\#miscreant.\|\#Usually.
Good man,\#good man.
Do you like\#the statues?
They were carved\#here by our ancestors\#a long time ago.
I guess\#they're alright.\|\#I'm no art\#critic, though.
That is fine.\.\#Everyone views\#art differently.
Find your\#own meaning.\|\#That is what my\#grandfather used to say.
Enjoy yourself, stranger.
Almost everyone\#has left to\#chase the thief.
Though the wind\#is blowing, there is\#a silence lingering\#in my heart.
I hope this is\#not the end for us.
He is staring vacantly.
Stumpy statue.
Slightly-less-stumpy statue.
This is the\#Cliff of Perpetuity.
The chasm rejects\#all who are not\#worthy to enter.
Go on.\.\#Test your worth.
Don't worry,\.\#you probably\#won't die.
I give it\#like a sixty\#percent chance.
The chasm awaits.
No one knows\#what exactly the pit\#seeks in men.
Not even the\#wise elders have been\#able to discern its ways.
Such a fickle thing.
\{Rejection!
You have been rejected\#by the Cliff of Perpetuity!
It seems you\#are not yet worthy\#of its embrace.
That's alright.\. Not\#many have ever\#actually passed the test.
Perhaps try again later.
You have been\#once again rejected\#by the Cliff of Perpetuity!
Not your lucky\#day today, is it?
Alas.
\{Acceptance?!
You have...\|\#you have been\#accepted by the\#Cliff of Perpetuity!
I know not how\#nor why,\. but the Cliff\#has chosen you to\#bear its power!
This is a\#historic moment!
Perhaps it is\#finally time for\#me to test\#my worth...
The power of the Cliff\#resonates with the Ancient Ring.
The rust has cleared away,\.\#revealing the Perpetual Ring!
You have passed the Cliff's challenge.\#It will no longer receive you.
A fellow man\#of rags, I see!
Been wearing\#them for long?
No.\| They\#weren't my\#first choice,\#believe me.
They're pretty\#comfy,\. though.
Seems like they've\#grown on you!\. Maybe\#in more ways than one!
Kikiki!
Rags are the\#ultimate form of clothing.
To see anyone\#wearing anything else...\|\#well,\. it makes me sick!
They must be\#completely delusional!
Is something\#happening right now?
As great as they\#are,\. I can't see very\#well with the rags on.
Smothered by rags.
Old mural, heavily eroded by time.
The view from\#here is pretty killer.
You can see way\#off into the distance.\|\#All of that...\. sand.
Maybe the\#view isn't\#so great\#after all.
The Elder says\#there's some kind of\#city across the wastes.
To think that\#something like that\#can exist in this\#fragmented world...
It must be paradise.
Once again, our peace\#is shattered by the ill\#intentions of an outsider.
And just when\#we were beginning to\#trust them, as well.
Choose your next\#steps carefully, rag man.
Our patience runs thin.
The Elder\#will determine\#our next\#course of action.
His wisdom has not,\.\#and will not,\. fail us.
A false\#dichotomy\#between two\#stray prophets...
Counterfeit truths for\#counterfeit people.
No such\#nonsense here.
The Land with No Sun\#is the unwavering rock in\#this sea of uncertainty.
The void above\#whispers to us the\#universal cosmic truth.
Will you listen,\|\#or will you turn deaf\#like all the rest?
Beware the shadows.\|\#They are no\#longer dormant.
Where did everyone go?
Away from the village.
They now seek\#the one who has\#betrayed our trust.
What did he do?
He stole a precious\#artifact from the elder.
An object which\#may hold the secrets\#of the universe within.
Sounds serious.
More than you\#could ever imagine.
Why didn't you\#go with them?
I am cursed to\#remain in the village\#for the rest of my days.
I also have\#a really bad rash\#on my left thigh.
Artifact...
Where...?
Watch your\#step,\. old man.
You'd be surprised\#how many just up and\#walk off cliffs without\#even realizing it.
As a species,\.\#it's almost kind\#of embarrassing...
I actually\#hate the desert.
But don't tell\#anyone I said that.
It watches.
They have the world in their palms.
This statue looks centuries old.
They don't\#know what\#they can't\#see,\. but me...
I can see it all.
In the cascade of\#dreams,\. I saw it.
Its form was angelic,\.\#its wings spread wide\#and its skin the\#color of blood.
What was it?\|\#The truth.
The truth that\#lies hidden in the\#crack between realities.
Perhaps you,\. too,\.\#will see it some day.
Pilfer the corpse?
Got a Joy Mask.
8 Magazines!
What the hey?
Joel?\. What's up?
Hat got snagged\#on somethin' weird.
All good now.\| Let's\#keep on goin-\^
Look out!
What in the hell?!
Joel!
Help me out, Lucky!\|\#Get this big son\#of a bitch off me!
Hold on!\. I'm coming!
God almighty.\| That\#was a little too\#close for comfort.
You have my\#sincerest thanks for\#this one, Lucky.
It was nothing.\.\#I'm just glad\#you're safe now.
Well, I'll be sure\#to watch my head\#from now on.
Let's hightail it.\|\#Don't feel safe in\#these caves no more.
You okay, Joel?
...Yeah.
What gives, Lucky?
Huh? What\#do you mean?
While that thing\#was strokin' and\#stranglin' me, you were\#just standing around.
I thought you\#were gonna help me.
Let's just get\#outta here.
A dried herb!
Oh, a new face.\|\#Welcome, welcome.
I am Raphael,\.\#and this is my\#humble bazaar.
I hope you\#find something of\#interest among my wares.
Though, I should\#probably warn you.
Much of my stock\#is cuisine native\#to our little village.
As such, it may\#not be exactly...\|\#attuned to your palate.
Oh, don't worry.
It can't be worse\#than rotten fruit and\#old, dried out meat.
You will have to\#be the judge of that.
Now, shall we\#conduct business?
Welcome back.
In the name of\#the elder, let us\#continue our business.
"Olathe Weather Institute: Outpost Gamma"
"Authorized Personnel Only"
"Beware of Scorpions"
Well-dressed bones.
Blasted bones.
Crushed bones.
"I'm sorry, guys, but this is where I step off.
"If anyone is still alive after all of this...
"Report back to HQ. Now."
"I'm not coming out, and you can't make me.
"Until whatever the hell this is stops,\#I'm holding down the fort here.
"Just leave me. Get out of here while you can.
"Contact HQ by any means necessary."
Who cares\#about coins?
The house\#is what we\#came for.
It's so\#much\#cooler\#up close...
If only\#I could\#smell\#this bad.
You smell\#just like it.
Are\#you God?
Money\#just can't\#compare.
...to the\#majesty\#of the\#house.
Isn't it\#beautiful?
What,\.\#the shack?
It's not\#just a\#shack.
It's a\#house.
THE house.
Okay,\.\. so\#who lives here?
No one\#knows.
But whoever it is,\#they are surely the\#foulest creature\#to walk this Earth.
That's a\#bit rude.
Step inside.
Then you\#will know true\#repugnence.
They say the\#world's first trash\#was born here,\.\#at this very spot...
That\#lovely\#stink...
Step\#inside...
...embrace\#the revulsion.
I'm good.
I got out of\#the counterfeit\#business ages ago.
The man who\#lives here must\#be a patron\#saint of trash.
A true\#paragon\#of all things\#garbage.
Can Larry\#Davis even\#compare?
Whoa,\#dude.
You\#are RANK.
You\#belong\#in there.
It's your\#place now.
Too much\#for you,\. eh?
Don't be\#ashamed.
The sheer density of\#the stench in that house\#could make even Bob\#Versace's stomach turn.
Only those\#truly in-tune\#with trash can\#withstand it...
You still\#are not\#ready.
You can never hope\#to enter without first\#understanding the\#meaning of trash.
Toilet Seat!
Books on meteorology\#and weather phenomena.
Horoscope written in chalk.
Dusty notebooks and mathematical texts.
To think,\. we became\#so careless as to let\#our greatest treasure\#be stolen away...
This transgression will\#not go unpunished.
The outsiders\#brought this\#wrath upon themselves.
When blood\#is inevitably\#spilled,\. it will\#be on their hands.
That outsider...\|\#the man wearing\#the yellow tie...
He is to blame\#for this wrongdoing.
We'll find him,\.\#and we'll take back\#what is rightfully ours.
Young man...
What is it\#that you seek?
A better place.
A better place\#to live, or a\#better place to thrive?
What do you mean?
A man can\#make anywhere his\#home, with enough time.
Men can live\#anywhere, as you\#have no doubt seen.
But to thrive,\#one must search.
For how long\#have you searched\#for that place?
Ever since the\#world went to hell.
Mmm...
Life rewards those\#who are patient.
You will find\#that "better place"\#in time, that I am\#certain of.
He gave you a medicinal herb.
You have my\#best wishes.
Go now.
Your utopia is\#still out there.
All you have\#to do is find it.
He is hollow.
So, do you\#understand now\#what must be done?
Yes, wise elder.
Affirmative.
Retreive the pill,\.\#and ensure its safe\#return to the sanctum.
Failure is not\#a possibility.\| If the\#artifact is lost...
You may as\#well take your\#own lives.
We understand,\#Ciosmorosin.
We will not\#fail you, for the\#sake of our people.
Good...
Now,\. abscond.
Leave it to us.
Don't disturb the\#great elder, outsider.\|\#His concentration must\#not be broken.
Ciosmorosin is\#one of the wisest\#humans to ever grace\#this foul Earth.
We bring him\#mystical objects,\. and\#in return, he endows\#us with cosmic knowledge.
Do you understand now?\|\#The importance of the\#elder's unwavering spirit?
No...\| outsiders will\#never be able to\#comprehend his ways.
Leave the village.\|\#You don't belong here.
Would\#you look\#at that...
Someone's finally\#found our little\#patch of Hell again...
Nothing,\.\#that's what.
Nothing's\#happened here\#for decades.
Time's just\#gone on,\. and\#on,\. and on.
Decades?
It hasn't\#been THAT\#long since\#we visited.
Dunno what\#planet you're\#living on.
Has to be\#almost thirty\#years since I've\#seen your mug.
And what\#about those\#guys the\#Elder sent out?
Yeah,\. what\#about them?
They\#still haven't\#come back.
We waited\#for years,\. very,\#very patiently.
But there\#was no\#sign of 'em.
Long, long\#time since\#anyone's been\#around here.
Not even the Elder, in\#all his infinite wisdom,\#could stop himself\#from crumbling to dust.
Take my\#advice, kid.
Leave\#this place.
Nothing left\#here but dust\#and old bones.
Do what\#we could never\#manage to,\.\.\#and move on.
Leave.
For your\#own good.
The Elder's head.
The machine is busted.
Someone's coffee mug.

I came to watch\#some quality carnage,\#not get an earful.

Ah...\| So much\#more peaceful now,\#wouldn't you agree?
That Bellucci knows\#how to kill with style.
I gotta steal\#some of his moves.

Chriss is good,\#but I know I'm better.
He won't expect\#my legendary Double-\#Decker drop kick.
Oh man, he\#is so cooooool.
I used to watch\#him on TV when\#I was just a kid.
Chriss was always\#my favorite, even then.
I never thought\#I'd live to see\#him in person...
I wonder if\#he'll sign my jersey...
You here to\#make me look\#good, rag man?
We have nothing\#that you need.
You already jumped in\#the ring. Too late\#to back out now.
Do you guys\#even know what\#you're about to\#experience?
I'm starting to\#get sick of the\#number eighty-eight.
The three\#guys at the\#village, we\#killed them all.
Whoa!
Never heard of 'em.
Vinny and Lin\#are dead, we\#killed them.
Is this some\#kind of weird\#fashion statement?
It's more\#than that.
But you\#wouldn't know.
You don't\#have a\#killer's\#spirit.
I can tell.
It doesn't matter\#who you kill.
These talentless\#jobbers running\#around are worth\#as much as pig shit.
They don't\#respect the\#business,\. the\#show,\. nothing.
Sometimes I wonder\#if I'm the only one\#who still gives a damn.
But I guess\#it doesn't matter\#in the end.

Still watching.
Gathering salt, I am.
Tasty salt,\.\#for the Allfather.

Salt, the\#Allfather\#must have.

Heh,\. I guess\#we should both\#be happy that\#we were wrong!
And hey,\.\#you're in luck!

Everything and\#anything you could\#want,\. all at\#Rando quality!
...That's the\#slogan anyway.

Oh, and...\|\#in mags,\. please.

Anyway, let's\#get down to\#business!
Hello again!
Ready to shop?
Come again soon!
Oh,\. you've\#got to be\#kidding me.
We go half\#way across Olathe,\.\#sail for days on\#that shitty raft...
...and we STILL\#can't get away\#from you trashmen!
Just our luck!
Nah,\. I'm\#just fuckin'\#with ya.
Good to\#see you\#again, old guy.
You know,\. a week back,\.\#I never thought I'd end up\#ditching Rando to become\#an honest merchant.
And yet\#here we are.
Just goes\#to show how\#easily things\#change nowadays.
If you ever\#need anything,\.\#we'll probably be\#here for a while.
Just remember\#that nothin's for free.
...Heh.
Who is who?
Who is you?
Me?\| I'm Grogno.
Who's that?
You scare me.
You scare ME.
It's quiet,\#isn't it?
I said\#it's quiet,\#isn't it?
You're not quiet.
That's not nice.
You're not nice.
No one\#likes poor\#Grogno...
Not even\#my friends\#like me.
Who...\| am I?
Stuck.
Very stuck.
So stuck.
Don't worry\#about me.
Just a\#little stuck,\. yes.
Twinkle,\. twinkle,\.\#little star.\| Do you\#wonder where we are?
Or did you\#forget that we\#were here?\| That's\#alright,\. if you did.
We are secret,\.\#we are hid.
You know,\#I can ALMOST\#understand you.
Almost.
Do not judge\#us,\. ragged man.\|\#We have sufffered\#through the Devil's plan.
The salt is\#evil,\. a horrid curse.\|\#So many it has\#led into a hearse.
It stole my\#eyes,\. my legs,\.\#my heart,\. oh yes.
It has put\#the entire lake\#under duress.
But the Purveyor\#has come to\#answer our prayers.
We give him\#salt to fuel\#his mind.
So one\#day he can\#break this bind.
He's in that\#cave,\. in case\#you wonder.
Step inside,\.\#go right under.
Let his mindful\#might bring you\#back into the light.

Dusty domes and weathered scrolls.

Ancient sarcophagus.\. One can only imagine\#what forgotten king lies within.
Bell chime.\| The attached note reads:\#"Ring-a-ding to trade a thing!"
Ring the bell?
Bell chime.
There's no telling what is in these jars.
Mint condition planetarium.
It's some kind of tent. Too small to fit inside.
It's some kind of display.
Esoteric scroll and a crystal ball.
Oh me,\. oh my.\|\#Who has come\#to this old sty?
Why the silence?\.\#Does your\#tongue show\#defiance?
Your name, friend,\.\#that's all I ask.\|\#Don't hide behind\#that stoney mask.
...I'm Alex.\. You are?
Ah, Alexander.\|\#Pretty name,\.\#should I gander.
As for me,\.\#it's tough, you see.
I'm a man\#of many names,\#titles, and so on.
To recite them\#all,\. we'd be\#up 'till dawn.
Well, just give\#me one, then.
There was one I\#was always fond of.\|\#Sweet to the ears,\#smooth like a dove.
"Dorimere," it was.\|\#Dorimere the Purveyor,\.\#a name with layers.
Purveyor of\#what, exactly?
Items of mystique,\#found on the mountain\#or in the creek.
So long as it's\#occult, it could be\#from any old dolt.
I'm not picky,\#sticky, or tricky.
So, you're like...\.\#a collector?
Yes, indeed.\| To\#collect is my creed.
The note said\#something about trading.\|\#Do you barter?
Of course,\. of course.\|\#Bring me a ruby,\.\#I'll give you a horse.
Not literally, though.\|\#That metaphor was\#just for show.
Stop by again\#if you find\#any oddities\#in your travels.
Their mysteries I\#crave to unravel.
In return, I can\#offer you pieces\#from my stash.
Some bold,\. some\#brash,\. some that will\#give you a rash.
It's up to you\#whether to go\#through,\. however.
I see.\| Well,\.\#I'll let you know\#if I find anything.
One more thing\#I'd like to add.
You've no doubt\#seen the jerseys,\.\#the ones that\#drive men mad.
I'm quite intrigued\#by them, as you\#see can by my den.
A reward I will\#give if you\#bring me ten.
Ten of those\#jerseys?\. I'll see\#what I can do.
Excellent, friend.\|\#Great times together\#we shall spend.
A monster in\#the mines coughed\#this thing up.\|\#You interested?
Oh, what is\#it that you\#bring to me?
Hold it close,\#let me see!
...Ah, a lung.\|\#Hardened,\. blackened,\.\#devoid of songs\#to be sung.
I see,\. I see!\|\#In my collection\#it must be!
In return,\.\#I'll offer these.\|\#Take whichever one\#you please.
Option one:\| a\#piece of gum.
Minty fresh,\. chew\#it up to get SP.
Just be warned,\.\#the taste will flee.
Or option two:\|\#this coat of blue.
Fashionable,\.\#yes,\. but wearing\#it could cause\#distress.
Light as a\#feather, your\#feet will fly.
But to your\#SP,\. say goodbye.
The gum\#or the\#coat for that\#lung of yours.
Pick quickly,\.\#don't make\#me snore!
So, which will\#you choose?\| Do\#be quick, don't\#make me snooze!
I'll take the gum.
The coat, please.
I need more time.
You exchanged the lung for a piece of gum!
A wistful pick.\|\#Chew on that\#when you get sick!
As for the\#organ,\. I'll take\#a peek.
Hopefully it\#will not leak.
Joel could\#probably use\#that coat.\. I'd\#like that, please.
You exchanged the lung for a sapphire coat!
Now you have\#something nice to wear.
Just don't blame\#me if you despair!
This knife won't\#stop screaming at me.\|\#What's your take?
A killer's\#tool,\. have\#we now?
Don't touch\#this or you'll\#say "ow!"
A haunted\#present and\#a chilling past.
I can see\#this steel is\#made to last.
I'll tell\#you what:\.\#this makes\#the cut.
For this blade,\.\#here is what\#I care to trade.
Your first\#choice is a\#sauce most hot.
Flaming flavor\#that will make\#your tongue\#burn and rot.
On the up\#side,\. a drop\#of this will\#boost your power.
Shred your\#foes and\#make them\#cower!
For your\#second pick,\#this glove\#most thick.
Terrifying\#strength it\#will deliver.
Slaps that\#break bones\#and make\#mountains quiver.
What it\#gives in power\#it takes in\#defense,\. however.
Get hit\#once and\#you're gone\#forever.
Not really,\|\#but you don't\#want to feel\#this feeling.
Some sauce\#or this glove\#for that knife.
Choose now,\.\#choose wise,\.\#without strife!
Now, make\#your choice!\.\#Speak your mind,\#raise your voice!
Give me the sauce.
I want the glove.
Let me think.
Give me\#the sauce.
You exchanged the cleaver\#for a bottle of hot sauce!
You're the\#boss.\. There\#it is, take\#your sauce!
This cleaver\#is going in\#my cutlery\#drawer.
Not for\#cooking,\. just\#for store.
That glove\#sounds good.
You exchanged the cleaver\#for a leather glove!
Four-fingered\#death coming\#your way.
Just be careful,\.\#or else you'll\#be flayed!
We pulled this\#fang off a snake.\.\#Still has some\#venom on it.
A deadly tooth?\.\#Sharp, venomous,\#and nasty...\. forsooth?
My interest\#it fails\#to pique.
It doesn't\#seem that\#unique,\. but...\|\#Let me see.
.\..\..\.Hold the phone,\.\#wait just a second!
This is no\#ordinary fang!\.\#It's from a\#rare species, I reckon!
Clover-spotted\#cobra, I believe.\|\#Presumably dead:\.\#a cause to grieve!
But now is\#not the time\#for tears.
That fang must\#be mine,\. it\#must be here!
In return,\.\#I'll part with\#this sanguine wine.
Delightful it is,\.\#a favorite of mine.
Just drink\#with care.\|\#This flavor kills,\.\#beware, beware.
Alternatively,\.\#consider these pants.
Tight and\#comfy and\#worth a glance.
Perhaps it\#is too attractive...\.\#Your foes will stick\#to you like magnets!
Wine or\#pants for\#your exotic tooth.
Pick either one;\|\#I don't care which,\.\#and that's the truth!
Of these,\. which\#will you pick?\|\#Don't make me wait,\.\#don't make me sick!
That wine is mine.
The pants seem nice.
I need some time.
That wine\#is mine.\.\#Hand it over.
You exchanged the fang\#for a bottle of Blood Wine!
Your drink, sire.\|\#Remember:\. the\#taste is dire!
The fang\#will look\#great in\#my display.
A rare\#find,\. I'll say!
The pants\#seem nice.\.\#I'll take them.
You exchanged the fang\#for some leather pants!
Here's your\#fit,\. your brand\#new swagger.
Walk straight,\.\#try not\#to stagger.
This stereo\#is saying some\#concerning things.\.\#Interested?
Ah,\. hold it\#close,\. let me listen.
.\..\..\.Yes, indeed,\.\#there is something\#wrong with\#this system.
A spirit, perhaps?\.\#An ancient curse?
Or maybe,\. something\#much, much worse...
Sounds like\#a good\#time to me!
As for you,\.\#well, let's see.
I have some\#human skin,\. from\#an arm and a shin.
Wrap it\#around yourself\#to protect\#from disease.
It sounds\#ironic,\. but trust\#me,\. it is\#no tease.
If that notion\#disgusts you,\. then\#consider this bomb.
Full of crude\#and hastily made,\.\#but it's better\#than any old grenade.
Give it a\#chuck and watch\#your foes duck!
The wraps or\#the bomb for\#your stereo.
What will it\#say to me?\.\#I must know!
So, which\#caught your eye?\.\#Don't take too\#long or I might cry!
Skin wraps? Sure...
The bomb is enticing.
Uh... I'll think about it.
Skin wraps?\. Sure...
You exchanged the stereo\#for some skin wraps!
As I promised,\.\#here's your skin.
Just be gentle,\.\#it's a little thin.
This stereo\#will fit great\#on my bedstand.
If I'm lucky,\.\#maybe it will\#play my favorite band.
A bomb?\.\#I could think\#of a few uses\#for that...
I'll take it.
You exchanged the stereo\#for a petroleum firebomb!
Careful,\. that\#thing is strong.
I would hate\#to see you\#use it wrong.
The last guys\#I tried to take\#this to didn't\#accept it.\| You?
What's this?\.\#A dirty magazine?
Dear boy, I\#have no use for\#this text unclean!
After all,\.\#what could be\#so mystic about\#a bunch of-\^
...Oh.
Ohhhhh!
I...\| I take\#it back!
I think a\#booklet like this\#is something I need!
Please,\. give\#it to me!\|\#Hear my plead!
.\..\..\.What's in\#it for me?
Oh, yes, yes.
Erm...\. how about\#some cigars?\|\#Three,\. no less!
A puff on\#these will cure\#your woes.
Just know\#that your lungs\#may decompose.
If that's\#not enough,\. how\#about this fez?
Wearing it\#expands your\#mind,\. or so\#it says.
The cigars or\#the fez for your\#delightful magazine.
Please,\. it\#needs to\#be seen...\|\#by me!
Well,\. which\#will it be?
Choose now;\|\#please,\. oh, please!
The cigars will do.
I'll have the fez.
Let me consider my choices.
The cigars\#will do.
You exchanged the Forbidden\#Magazine for three Premium Cigars!
Ah, that's great!\|\#Now you can have a\#smoke with your mates!
I'm going\#to be a\#bit busy\#for a while...
Hoh hoh...\|\#Just looking\#at this makes\#me smile...
I'll have\#the fez.
You exchanged the Forbidden\#Magazine for the All-Seeing Fez!
Nice choice.\.\#Don your new\#hat and rejoice!
I've heard\#these things\#can kill werewolves.\|\#Is that true?
Ah,\. a silver bullet!\|\#Quite the find\#you found this time.
It's been an\#age since I last\#saw one,\. but this\#seems to be legit.
These things\#used to be\#worth a lot,\.\#quite a bit.
So let's\#see...\| how\#about some sprats?
Sprats?\. What the\#heck is that?
An old\#Soviet treat.
They're like\#sardines, but just\#a little sweet.
Good for your\#stomach,\. bad for\#your heart.
Make sure\#to finish\#if you start.
If that deal\#seems fishy,\. why\#not take this\#rosary belt?
Made by old nuns,\.\#its quality is\#undoubtedly heartfelt.
Wear it and\#you'll regain some SP.
Just know,\. stancing\#with it on is\#considered heresy.
The sprats or\#the rosary belt\#for your bullet.
Don't keep\#it from me;\.\#you can't,\#you couldn't!
So, what\#will it be?
Do you\#like what\#you see?
Uh, the sprats?
Let me have the rosary.
Give me a minute.
Uh,\. the sprats?
You exchanged the Silver\#Bullet for some Century Sprats!
Enjoy them\#while they last.
And when\#they're gone,\.\#don't be downcast.
This bullet\#will go to\#my laboratory.
It must be\#studied;\. I must\#unveil its story.
Let me have\#the rosary.
You exchanged the Silver\#Bullet for an Old Rosary Belt!
"The power of\#the Lord shall\#guide you now."
...That's what\#the nuns would\#say,\. anyhow.
This globe\#is blank.\.\#What's up\#with that?
Hmm...\| a production\#error,\. it appears to me.
Let's just check\#when it was made;\.\#let me see...
...Year of\#our Lord,\. 1107.
Didn't they\#think the world\#was flat back then?
Maybe there\#is something\#peculiar about\#this globe after all.
I'll take\#it, then.\.\#Heed its call.
And in\#return,\. how\#about some tubes?
Tubes of\#what,\. toothpaste?
Not quite.
It's paste,\#alright,\. but not\#of the tooth type.
This paste\#was made to\#suit the tastes\#of cosmonauts.
Yes, the Soviet\#starlets who danced\#across the canvas\#of the universe.
Do take note,\.\#it might not\#taste great to\#those on Earth.
Alternatively,\.\#consider this\#rainbow paint.
It's pretty,\.\#and with it in\#tow,\. a weakling\#you ain't.
It might make\#you a little\#slow, though.
The tubes or\#the paint for\#your globe.
It would\#look great\#on my wardrobe...
Now,\. do\#we have\#a deal?
Let me know,\.\#give me your spiel!
I'd like to try those tubes.
Bring me the rainbow.
I'll get back to you.
I'd like to\#try those tubes.
You exchanged the Vagabond's Globe\#for fifteen Cosmonaut Food Tubes!
There you are,\.\#end of discussion.
I do hope\#you can read\#Russian...
I'm going\#to give this\#globe a whirl.
See what happens,\#see what unfurls.
Bring me\#the rainbow.
You exchanged the Vagabond's Globe\#for some Rainbow Painter's Gear!
Your paint,\.\#my friend.
Don't worry,\.\#the colors\#won't blend.
Oh,\. what's that\#I smell?\| Scraps\#plucked from the\#gates of Hell?
Yes,\. of course!\|\#Infinity Jerseys,\. fresh\#from the source!
You've done well,\.\#my friend.\| Now I\#shall uphold my end.
...Wait,\. hold on,\.\#stop right there!
You have more,\.\#I do declare!
What a treat\#this is!\| When it\#comes to jerseys,\.\#you're a wiz!
Another reward,\.\#here you go.\| This\#will help you\#steal the show!
Return to me\#with the fruits\#of your labor.
For their\#tastes I do\#wish to savor.
Oh,\. by\#the way,\. I've\#been meaning\#to say...
Your demeanor\#now scares me.
I'm not\#a fan of\#this killing spree.
But I\#won't stop\#you,\. as if\#I ever could.
Just do\#as your heart\#desires,\. as\#it feels you should.
But don't\#expect me to\#come greeting\#you then.
People like\#those aren't\#welcome in\#this den.
The path you\#tread is now\#quite frightening.
The knot\#in your chest\#ever still is\#tightening.
Continue to\#kill,\. and the\#urges may\#never cease.
But by\#then,\. I suppose\#you will be\#at peace...
In this world,\.\#taking a life\#is inevitable.
However,\. kill\#too many and\#matters become\#questionable.
You have\#enough blood\#on your\#hands already.
Continue this\#path and things\#might get unsteady.
He's fixated on the water.
Still not\#enough gathered.
Into the\#ocean I\#must now go.
The only\#way,\. this is...
You again...
I see\#you took\#my advice.
That I did.
Still don't\#know how\#to feel\#about it all.
The air\#out here...\|\#it's clean.
I'm not\#used to it.
It takes\#some adjustment,\.\#trust me.
But I think you'll come\#to see that the world\#is much more than\#that island of trash.
I pray\#you're right,\. son...
Quick word\#of advice,\. though.
Hm?
Steer clear\#of that city\#up above.
It's not\#a good place\#for people\#like you.
I'll take\#your word\#for it.
Crusty recliner.
You got the stuff?
We do. Here.
You gave away your Man-Made Salts.
There it is!\|\#Now we can get\#to the fun part!\#HA HA!
Just a\#second now!
Sounds like\#it's done, HA HA!
Behold!\.\#A Salt Crab\#family recipe!
Got a Salt Cake!
Oh, thanks.
My pleasure,\#HA HA!
Oh, you\#know what?
You guys\#are fun.\. I\#think I'll be\#sticking around.
We're gonna\#be a merry\#band, HA HA!
Hey,\. hold\#the phone.
Are you\#really about to\#let this freak\#join the party?
I don't\#see the\#harm in it.
He's friendlier\#than most of\#the people in\#this town.
There is\#no way I'm\#hanging out with\#this crusty hermit.
I can handle\#weirdos,\. but I\#draw the line\#at salt people.
Wow!\.\#What an asshole!\.\#HA HA!
Geen...\|\#are you\#really going\#to do this?
You better\#believe it.
It's me\#or him, Alex.\.\#You can't\#have both.
The choice\#is yours,\#big guy.
But you\#know what\#the right\#answer is, HA HA!
Choose Salt Crab.
Choose Geen.
Sorry, Geen,\.\#but I don't\#want to deny\#him this chance.
He's coming\#with us,\. whether\#you want him\#to or not.
I knew\#you were\#a smart guy!\#HA HA!
Hmph, I see.
Then this is\#where we part\#ways, Alex.
Well,\. if that's\#what you want.
I suppose this\#is farewell.
Yeah.\. It is.
You're good\#guys,\. don't\#get me wrong.
I'm wishing\#you all the\#best going forward.
I just wanna\#leave off on\#a high note.
I understand.
Bye,\. Geen.
See you around...
Geen Jean has left your party.
So much\#for that bozo!\#HA HA!
Now, shall\#we get going?
Salt Crab joined your party...?
Also received an Aromatherapy Guide!
I hate\#that you're\#making me\#do this.
But, if\#it will\#make you\#happy...
Sorry, salt guy.\.\#We can't let\#you join.
Bake a\#man a cake,\.\#and this is\#the thanks I get?
Figures as\#much, HA HA!
Fine then,\#you and Mr.\#Big Butt can\#go on your way.
But don't\#ask me for\#any more favors!
...I'm sorry.
That was\#probably a\#bit selfish\#of me.
What's done\#is done.
Let's just get\#out of here.
Then get back\#to work! HA HA!
Musty lightbulb.
Rusty oven.
"Home is where the heart is."
Mother Sangria,\.\#grant us eons!
Eons of\#great joy and\#pleasure!
Saaaaalt,\|\#salty, salty,\#salty-daaaaaay!
He's lost in the music.
Hear me,\.\#Sangria!
I sing\#for you!
Saaaalt,\|\#salty, salty,\#salty-daaaaay!
Sangriaaaa,\|\#salty, salty,\#forever, heeeey!
Saaaalt,\. for\#you and me\#and every waaaaay!
Hear us now,\.\#hear us then,\.\#hear us\#every daaaaay!
Salty-daaaay,\|\#forever,\. hey!
We shall live\#forever,\. blessed\#by salt for\#all our days!
The city shall\#burn,\. but the\#salt will remain unturned!
Forever!\|\#Forever,\. heeeey!
We're done here.
Hey, Lucky.\.\#Make some\#new friends?
I think I did.
That's good\#to hear.
Welp,\. back\#on the road\#for us.
Rejoined your party!
Salt for\#the Allfather,\.\#I must get.
Allfather grows\#hungry,\. he does.
Salt to\#fuel his\#mind,\. he needs.
A headache,\.\#I am getting.
Bless us,\.\#Allfather.
Bless the\#salt in\#our lungs.
.\..\..Salt...
Feed me salt...\|\#and I shall\#give you...\|\#wisdom...
Feed salt to the Allfather?
Gave some Man Made Salt.
Very well.
Hear this wisdom\#and heed its sound:
Above the\#lair of those\#bound by gold...
In a cave\#whose walls run\#deep with blood...
There lies\#entrenched a\#tool of slaughter.
Find this\#tool and offer\#it to the\#purveyor.
That is all.
Bring more\#salt to hear\#more wisdom.
Salt for\#wisdom...
Salt for\#the mind.
Where the serpents\#perch to watch\#the others play...
You will\#soon find\#fangs bared\#at you.
Dodge its\#bite and\#pull its tooth.
While it still\#drips with venom,\.\#offer it to\#the purveyor.
Along the\#long dead road...
Within a\#cave hidden\#beside the\#broken bridge...
An ancient\#voice speaks\#its haunted tongue.
Cover your\#ears and offer\#its sound to\#the purveyor.
On the mountain\#of blood,\. a great\#hunter once lived...
In his pocket,\.\#that which can\#kill the unkillable.
Ring the bell\#and slay this\#slayer of beasts.
Take his prized\#possession and offer\#it to the purveyor.
Atop the mountain\#of blood,\. within\#the palace of carnage...
Inside the\#office of the\#one betrayed\#by his fate...
A traveller's\#tool remains,\.\#directionless.
Offer the silent\#globe to the purveyor.
I have\#no more\#wisdom to share.
Go now,\. bearer\#of salt,\. and\#seek that which\#you still seek.
It is cool.
You're the\#man I always\#wanted to be.
Not ashamed\#to admit that.
There's still\#time, you know.
Time to\#make that change.
Can't believe myself...
I think I'm\#starting to agree.
Stay safe, Alex.
The world needs\#folks like you.
You're a\#good guy, Alex.
Not something\#I can say for\#many nowadays.
I hope\#you liked\#the song.
It was great.
Have fun\#out there,\#magic man.
Don't fall\#off your\#broomstick.
So I said,\.\#"I'm going\#to see Jack."
And they said,\.\#"Who's Jack?"
I look 'em\#both in the\#eyes and say,\|\#"Jack Daniels."
Nice one,\#Nicky.
Bet they\#got a hoot\#outta that!
Heh,\.\#yeah...
Say,\.\#who's that?
The hell\#are you?
How'd you\#find us?
We were\#exploring,\. and\#we just happened\#to find that rope.
My name is-\^
I don't give\#a damn who\#you are.
Ain't no one\#welcome here.
Leave,\. 'fore I\#get real ornery.
Sorry, we'll get going.
We don't mean any harm.
Sorry,\. we'll\#get going.
Scram.
We don't\#mean any harm.\|\#We just want\#to have a-\^
You deaf, boy?
I said LEAVE.
Yo, Ron,\.\#cool it,\. man.
These guys\#don't look\#like trouble.
Yeah, they\#seem normal\#enough.
Not like\#those jersey\#freaks.
Man, you\#always get\#like this.\. Don't\#be so tense.
I don't\#trust 'em.
Can't trust\#no one\#no more.
Come on, Ron.\|\#Put down\#the gun.
I'm sorry.\.\#We'll get out\#of your hair.
Gah,\. wait.
I might've\#been a\#little harsh.
You can stay,\.\#if ya want.
Well,\.\#you can.
Your big hat\#friend needs to\#go.\. He makes\#me worried.
Same with\#that big\#ass fellow.
And that\#salt freak.\|\#He scares me.
Are you\#okay with\#that, Joel?
Don't bother\#me none,\. Lucky.
I'll be\#up top.
Come on,\#big man.\.\#Have a seat.
Spot's open\#right next\#to the fire.
Oh, alright.
Hey hey,\#now it's\#a party!
Yo, Lewy,\.\#get some\#tunes goin',\#will ya?
You got it.
That's what\#I'm talkin' about!
Ahh...
What brings you\#guys here,\. to\#this lonely cave?
It's a\#long story,\.\#brother.
To sum\#it up,\. we're\#all a bunch\#of losers.
Aw, don't\#be so hard\#on yourselves.
We're all\#in a rough\#place these days.
Nah, man.\.\#We've been in\#a rough place\#for a long time.
Way before that\#damned "Game,"\. and\#especially before those\#jersey bastards.
We've never\#really fit in\#anywhere.
This town is\#our home, but\#we feel like\#we don't belong.
I guess\#I'm not that\#different.
Can't recall\#the last time\#I felt like I\#belonged anywhere.
That place,\. if\#it even exists...
That's what\#I'm looking for.
What will\#you do if you\#can't find it?
That place,\.\#I mean.
I don't\#like to think\#about that.
Better to\#keep looking\#forward, I say.
We all\#used to\#think like that.
But then\#reality hit\#us square\#in the face.
Our time\#is up now.
All we\#can do is\#sit and drink\#'till we die.
Now, you\#know that's\#not true.
There's always\#a second chance\#waiting for you.
You've just\#gotta find it.
I like\#you, kid.
You have\#a spark that\#the rest of\#us ain't got.
Been a\#long time since\#I've seen that.
Well,\. I\#hope I can\#pass that\#spark along.
Light some\#fires inside\#of you guys, too.
What are you,\.\#an arsonist?
Damn, I\#can't remember\#the last time\#Ron smiled like that.
You've cast\#a spell on\#him, new guy.
No way!\.\#A real\#life witch!
Can you\#make me\#find true love?\.\#With your magic?
Careful now,\.\#he might just\#turn you into\#a frog.
Well,\. it's\#been fun.
But I should\#probably get\#going now.
Aw, so soon?\|\#You just got here!
I know,\#but I don't\#want to keep\#my friend waiting.
You're fine.\| I think\#we of all people\#should know how\#important friends are.
You've been\#great company,\. man.
Best wishes.
Hey,\. Alex.
Yeah,\. Ron?
I'm glad\#you showed up.
You're very welcome.
So I said,\.\#"I'm going\#to see Mary."
And they said,\.\#"Who's Mary?"
I look 'em\#both in the\#eyes and say,\|\#"Mary Jane-"\^
Hey, it's\#that guy again.
Thought I\#told you to\#fuck off, boy.
You've got\#three seconds to\#turn your ass\#around and get.
Look,\. we\#don't want\#trouble.\. We\#just want to-\^
I didn't\#fuckin' stutter.
Get outta\#here right now.
I-\.\^
RIGHT\. NOW.
Whoa, Ron,\.\#take it easy.
Shut the\#hell up, Lewy.\.\#These asshats don't\#know how to listen.
You're being\#dramatic,\. Ron.
We're not\#like this.
You don't\#know me...
I'm fixin'\#to put one\#between your\#eyes, rag boy.
Get\| the fuck\| OUT.
Oh, God\#fuckin' damn it!
Stupid piece\#of shit gun...
Guess we're\#doin' this the\#old-fashioned way.
Just go.
He gave you 25 magazines.
That's all\#to my name.
Now go,\.\#leave us alone.
You...!
You don't\#know what\#you've just done!
I'll kill all\#you bastards\#one day!
I'll kill you,\.\#even if takes\#the rest of\#my life!
You're gonna\#fuckin' pay for\#what you've\#done to us!
You should leave.
And don't\#come back.
You'll all\#get what's\#comin' to ya...
Mark my words.
Mark my\#fuckin' words!
The curse of\#red and green\#has enveloped\#all of Downtown.
Won't be long\#now before they're\#pounding at our\#front door.
Worry not,\#friend.\| They won't\#get past me.
They thrive on\#fear, but they\#can't scare me.
Being afraid\#makes my hip\#act up, anyway.
Master Ottoman\#will ensure this\#plague ends promptly.
He has always\#been the most\#insightful of the\#gang leaders.
But even if\#his plans happen\#to fail,\. he has\#trained us well.
The situation\#will resolve itself\#one way or another.
Like I said...
They won't\#get past me.
I will skewer\#one thousand men\#before I let our\#precious Game die.
I'm still\#on the hunt\#for some\#new gear.
Everything I\#had before was\#swindled off me\#by some punk doctor.
Told me he'd\#take me somewhere\#nice,\. and the next\#thing I knew...
Gone.\| Everything\#but my pants.
Glad he\#left those.
No one\#wants to see\#me in my\#birthday suit!
Careful who\#you trust, friend.
Never know\#when you might\#come across\#a backstabber!
Rejoice, brothers!
The Game\#is dead!
The serpents'\#heads have\#been cut off!
The era\#of Infinity\#is upon us!
Go now!
Spread carnage\#as far as\#the eye can see!
This is\#our purpose!\.\#Our destiny!
All of this\#carnage, all of\#this blood spilled...
And yet,\. I\#am at peace.
To obtain true\#harmony,\. one must\#dominate the\#mortal coil.
It will try\#to fight you, to\#control your will,\.\#but it can be quelled.
Once the\#tension of its\#grip fades, that\#is when you know.
You have\#obtained peace.
The wisdom of\#Zein Ka is not\#to be trifled with.
That is why\#we will prevail.
The haze red\#fades away,\. we\#will be on top\#of the world.
This I\#am sure of.
Peace in life,\.\#peace in death.
Ey, hombre,\.\#watch yourself.
This is el\#territorio de\#Zein Ka.
Touch the\#snake, and\#you'll get bit!
Whatever game you\#all are playing,\.\#we're not interested.
Man, that's\#so lame.
How do\#you live such\#a boring life?
Spice it\#up, hermano!\.\#Make it picante!
Tonight is\#the night\#the snake\#rears its fangs!
We will\#coil around\#the other gangs\#and reign supreme!
The Game\#WILL be ours!
Enjoy the view?
I'd like it\#better if there\#were more to look\#at than ruins.
Heh, I think it's\#beautiful anyway.
There's a\#certain majesty\#to wanton carnage,\.\#don't you think?
I guess\#you could look\#at it like that.
I prefer more\#conventionally\#pretty things, though.
Sure.
This palate\#of mine...\| it's\#an acquired taste.
My comrades\#elected to be\#a part of\#the action.
The rush of\#a good fight\#gives their\#lives purpose.
Not me, though.
I'm just\#an observer.
A good pair\#of eyes is\#a valuable thing\#these days.
Would hate\#to lose them.
Have you ever\#wondered what\#lies on the other\#side of the horizon?
I've been\#wondering since\#I was just\#a little kid.
Even this\#high up, there\#are things you\#still can't see.
It's almost\#poetic, isn't it?
I wouldn't know.\|\#I've never been\#the artsy type.
Me neither,\#but this\#is one of\#those things...
You can\#practically feel it.
The air\#tastes bitter\#tonight.
I like\#it that way.
Those Bad\#Boys just got\#wiped off the\#face of the Earth.
I saw\#everything\#from this\#very spot.
You should've\#been here.\|\#The slaughter\#was incredible.
A real sight\#for sore eyes,\.\#I'll say that.
I always\#knew this\#game was\#destined to die.
Glad I got\#to see that\#downfall here\#tonight.
People like\#to give snakes\#a bad rap.
But once you\#get to know one,\#you'll see that they're\#sweet as can be.
Take Clover, here.
This cobra\#is better behaved\#than some humans\#I know!
Funny thing,\.\#innit?
It doesn't\#bite, does it?
Just people\#she doesn't like.
Which is\#most people.
Sit, Clover!\|\#Good girl!
Clover's getting\#a bit restless.
It's a shame\#that other rat\#I had went missing.
It would've\#been a great\#treat for my\#good girl!
Don't worry,\#Clove,\. Santana\#will get you\#some grubs soon!
Once you\#taste the flesh\#of man,\. you\#cannot resist!
The serpent\#devours all!
¡La carne\#de la vida!
Thankfully, it seems docile.
Nice snake?
Guess not.
Junked junker.
The Devil's Knot\#will strangle\#all opposition!
Bite the snake,\.\#and the snake\#will bite you back!
I have the\#power of the sun\#in my fingertips!
You think\#you're better\#than us,\. worm?
I don't think.\|\#I know.
You're askin' for\#an ass-beating.
You'd better\#fuck off before\#I skin you\#like a snake!
I'm not going\#anywhere,\. tubby.
You wanna\#touch me?\|\#Step right\#up then.
Oh, that's it!\.\#I'm gonna\#smack you silly!
Psh,\. you\#Bad Bitches\#are all the same.
Some good\#all that lip\#flapping did you.
No wonder\#the Franchise\#has you all\#so chewed up.
You're nothing\#but dead meat.
Geez, man.\|\#It's just\#a game.
I wasn't even\#gonna hit you\#that hard...
Does anyone\#else smell\#apple pie?
Perfume and domestic jerky!
The water is flowing gently.
It's filled with viscera.
We're fightin'\#an uphill\#battle here.
Franchise grindin'\#through ranks,\.\#Knot snakes breathin'\#down our necks...
I feel like\#a ferret in\#a shoebox.
I can't\#even sleep\#at night.
God damn\#knee keeps\#on actin' up.
And that\#fuckin' Bart...
Hate his guts.
Look at\#ol' Abram\#down there.
Got him\#good yesterday,\.\#yessiree.
He might\#never talk\#to me again,\#but I got him!
What did\#you even do?
Oh,\. something\#that really got\#under his skin.
I flipped his\#eyepatch around\#while he was asleep!
You should've seen\#the look on\#his face when he\#woke up,\. totally blind!
Gah heh heh heh!
I'm a master\#trickster, I am.
Fringe Boy\#needs my\#type around.
Look, it\#was just\#a prank, man.
A fun\#little joke.
Nothing to\#get worked\#up over.
My eyesight\#is NOT\#a joke.
Ever since 'Nam,\.\#I've been worried\#about my other eye.
I thought\#I'd finally\#gone blind!
If what\#you did was\#really a joke,\.\#I'd be laughing.
Well...\| I\#was laughing.
Fuck you.
I'm going\#to get you\#back for this.
And when\#I do,\. you\#definitely WON'T\#be laughing.
Uh huh...
We'll SEE\#about that.
You are\#a bitch.
I can't\#take all\#this stress, man.
We were\#on the cusp\#of winning it all.
Then that\#damn Franchise\#came tearin' through.
What shit luck.
Fringe Boy\#better talk some\#sense into those\#pompous jackasses.
His raw,\.\#unfiltered nature\#is what we\#need right now.
I'm starting\#to get nervous.
The meeting\#should've been\#over by now.
When is\#Fringe getting back?
All this\#anxiety is\#driving me\#to drink.
More than\#I normally\#do, anyway.
Yo,\. that's\#my hair gel!
Thought one\#of those damn\#golden boys\#took it...
Pass it\#this way,\. boss.
You gave back the Bad Boy hair gel.
Ah,\. that's\#the stuff.
Let me\#hook you\#up as thanks.
Received some goodies!
Horse jerky, potato liquor, and 15 mags!
It's so\#empty around\#here lately.
We've just\#been getting\#raw-dogged from\#all sides...
The Game\#is about victory,\.\#not slaughter.
That fuckin'\#Franchise breaks\#the entire\#point in half.
Bad Boys\#are a\#dying species.
But the\#Franchise keeps\#on getting bigger...
How long\#'till it\#swallows\#us whole?
Fringe needs\#to hurry up\#and head back.
That meeting\#will mean nothing\#if we're all gone\#when he gets here.
Franchise?\.\#Devil's Knot?\.\#The Corps?
They ain't shit.
I've got a\#secret weapon.
I wouldn't\#trust those\#pills if I\#were you.
Who are you,\.\#my grandpa?
I do what\#it takes to win,\.\#geezer.
And this stuff?
It'll make\#me a winner.
Next time\#some jerseyheads\#come around,\.\#I'll say hello.
And they'll\#say goodbye.
Well,\. I'm\#a bit pissed.
Those masked\#motherfuckers said\#the pills make\#you stronger.
But I don't\#feel any tougher.
I just\#feel empty.
And my\#head is\#all fuzzy...
God, what\#a waste of\#good mags.
Someone's ride.
Scrapped semi-truck.
Whatcha doin',\#old fart?\. Crusin'\#for a bruisin'?
Not particularly.\.\#We're just\#passing through.
Like hell\#you are.
Think you can\#come in and\#waltz around our\#turf like you own it?
Hey,\. what's\#the big idea?
You tryna\#kill me?
Sorry that I\#fought back when\#some punk swung\#a knife at me.
That's how we\#play "The Game"!
It's rough,\.\#but it's fun!
You and I\#have two very\#different ideas\#of what's "fun."
You...\| suck.
Go on, gramps.\|\#Go be boring\#somewhere else.
Ha,\. I win again!
Nice effort,\#pops,\. but\#I'm still\#the best.
Scram.\.\#Thanks for\#the good fight.
Jesus,\. I\#think you\#broke something.
What kind\#of jacked up\#old timer\#are you?
Go on,\.\#find a bandage\#for you booboo.
What are\#you doing\#back here?!
I thought\#you said you\#didn't want\#to play The Game!
Just passing\#through again.
Of course\#you fucking are.
People your\#age love to\#do a lot of\#"passing."
Back for\#another ass-\#kicking, gramps?
I think I've\#had enough of\#that for today.
Ha, that's right!
...That was\#uncalled for.
Where's your\#stripes,\. geezer?
All Bad Angels\#need the classic\#black 'n' white!
Well,\. I'm\#not exactly-\^
Good thing\#I packed\#a spare.
He gave you a striped tank top.
Uhhh...\|\#Thanks.
Those golden\#bastards think\#they're so cool.
Honestly,\. what's\#their obsession\#with shiny shit?
What are\#they,\. cats?
Gotta chase\#the laser?
Psh.
I hate cats.
Just a box.
Y-young man!
I say,\.\#you have\#emerged from\#the very ground!
Do you\#even know\#what is\#down there?
Well, there's\#some guys\#who want to-\^
Rats!\| Nasty,\#filthy rats!
You're liable\#to catch\#the plague!
Do refrain\#from spelunking\#anymore,\. okay?
For your\#own benefit.
Oh dear...
I don't think\#this was the\#right club to\#sign up for.
All these\#youngsters are\#too rough and\#tumble for me.
And this\#jacket doesn't\#really fit my\#asethetic.
Oh,\. what\#a pickle...
Why does\#this game need\#to be so\#violent?
Can't we settle\#our disputes over\#a nice game\#of checkers?
I'm so\#lonely here...
No one\#wants to take\#time to entertain\#a geezer like me.
Well, have\#you tried\#making friends?
Social interaction\#frightens me.
I wish\#my grandkids\#were still\#with me...
Just a\#shame they\#both became\#drug dealers.
They call\#us angels,\#but don't\#be fooled!
We're bad\#as they come!
Daddy always\#said I was\#a misfit.
And I've\#lived to\#prove him right!
Yo, Trip,\.\#you alright,\. man?
You're like,\#all distant.
I'm fine.
Just took\#some bad\#medicine.
Just checkin'.
Would hate\#to see a\#fellow Bad Boy\#in a bad place!
An explosion went off here.
Crispy giblets.
Scorched leg.
Grab ya\#umbrella,\. here\#comes tha storm!
I guess it\#was a good\#thing that Kamil\#didn't come back.
Suppose so.\.\#Damn brat finally\#got lucky.
Wonder where\#he scampered\#off to this time.
Don't think\#it really matters.
Anywhere's\#better than here.
Maybe he's\#already turned\#heel with\#the jerseys...
Well,\. that\#worked out\#about as good\#as I expected.
Technically,\.\#we got what\#we wanted.
Yeah,\. but still.
Would've been\#better if half\#of us didn't\#end up dead.
Or would it?
Part of me\#is gonna miss\#ol' Skullface.
He was\#full of passion.\|\#Fiery,\. explosive\#passion.
A true\#Tic Tonic\#spirit, he had.
Nah, he\#was a piece\#of shit.
He was,\.\#but he was a\#PASSIONATE\#piece of shit.
Guess that\#passion didn't\#get him very\#far,\. though.
Watch the\#blood flow\#down and down.
Down the\#spiral it\#all goes.
It's been\#a while since\#those Dynamite\#freaks showed up.
Wonder if\#that asshole\#Tic Tonic is\#planning something.
They almost\#got banned\#from The Game\#one time.
Guess they\#didn't think car\#bombs would\#break the rules.
Wish Fringe\#had pushed harder\#for them to\#get kicked out.
I came back\#to see what\#my old crew\#was up to.
And what\#do you know!\.\#They've all\#been clobbered!
Damnnnnn shame.
They didn't\#even leave\#any for me.
How rude!
You thought\#you were real\#tough,\. ey, Sid?
Well who's\#the tough\#guy now?!
Not you!\.\#You're stone\#cold dead,\#motherfucker!
Finally got to\#pay you back\#for all the shit\#you gave me.
God, that\#was cathartic.
If I never\#kill again, I\#will not be\#dissatisfied.
Broken bottle.
Whew...
No one ever\#told me mopping\#up fools would\#be such hard work.
Can't quit\#now, though.\.\#Gotta score that\#second fold.
Just a\#couple more.
Don't go\#anywhere,\. old man.
Once I've\#caught my breath,\#you're good\#as dead.
Just...\|\#gimme a minute.
Still recharging.\|\#Don't leave,\. okay?
Okay, I'm\#ready now.
Hey,\. where\#are you going?
We aren't\#done yet!
Yes, we are.
I think\#I'm due\#for another\#recharge.
I'll,\. uh...
...let you\#know when\#I'm ready.
What are you-\.\^
Sh, don't disturb us.
This is a game\#that requires absolute\#focus to play perfectly.
You've gotta get\#into your opponent's head...\.\#deconstruct their entire\#psychological profile.
The MOMENT you\#let your guard down,\#they'll strike before\#you can even blink.
It's truly brutal...
And this game is...?
Rock Paper Scissors.
Easy to understand,\.\#extremely punishing to master.
That's the\#beauty of RPS.
The Game is\#dead,\. my friends\#are dead,\. Downtown\#is done for...
But I will\#not lose.
With my\#last breath,\#I will emerge\#triumphant.
Witness the\#strength of\#my resolve!
His will is laser-focused.
We've been going\#at it for two\#days straight now.
Neither of us\#can seem to break\#through the other's defenses.
I'm starting to wonder...\.\#is he cheating somehow?
How do you cheat\#at Rock Paper Scissors?
I\. don't\. know.\|\#But I can't rule\#out this possibility.
Yuri's going to\#crack any time now.
He's been trying\#to get into my head,\#but I've blocked him out.
Without a doubt,\#victory will be mine.
I did not\#watch my entire\#gang get gutted\#just to quit now.
They're counting on me...
They're looking\#down from Heaven\#and cheering me on!
I can't fail.\.\#I WON'T fail.
He's putting everything he has into it.
I just\#wanna gut\#a motherfucker\#right now.
Fuckin' Game...\|\#Fuckin' rules...
Those Bad Angels\#are dumb as bricks.
They got cocky,\. and\#now those jerseys\#are feeding them\#some humble pie.
Goes to show\#that in "The Game,"\.\#you don't win until\#you win it all.
Not that I LIKE\#seeing them get\#stabbed,\. gutted,\. slashed,\.\#speared,\. and ground to mush.
I just think\#it's fitting.\|\#Thematically.
You can miss\#me with these\#prissy pissing matches.
We're Americans.\.\#We're supposed to\#be united,\. not\#divided,\. damn it!
Where's the\#love for your\#fellow patriots?
And those\#Infinity freaks?
Forget about it.
I fly with the\#red, white, and blue,\. not\#the red, green, and ugly.
Man,\. this place\#is fucked up.
If Olathe is\#up shit creek,\.\#then this place\#fucking drowned in it.
It's almost\#a bit mesmerizing,\.\#just how awful\#it all is.
Maybe I'll\#stick around\#for a while.
See if this\#ship can sink\#any lower.
I regret\#ever leaving\#Garbage Island.
This place\#is worse than\#any rotten trash\#ever could be.
I miss\#that good,\#foul stench.
All I smell\#here is blood.
This entire\#Alley is\#easy pickings.
What about\#you,\. old man?
Wanna see\#the inside\#of your head?
No thanks.
That was\#a rhetorical\#question.
I said\#I'm not\#interested.
Well...\|\#this is\#awkward.
Can you\#hear them?
The screams?\|\#So vivid\#and afraid?
They won't\#leave me be.\.\#They won't get\#out of my HEAD.
They're coming\#for me,\. I know it.
They will\#be upon\#me at\#any moment...
God,\. what\#did I do\#so wrong?
I'm scared,\. man.
They're gonna\#get us next,\.\#I can just tell.
Don't act\#like that.
We just\#need to\#stay calm.
There's a\#way out of\#here,\. there\#has to be.
When the\#path clears,\.\#we run\#for it.
We run\#and never\#look back.
I don't\#know if my\#legs can\#make it...
This isn't\#the end.
I won't\#let it be.
If we make\#it out of here,\.\#I'm going straight\#back to Garbage Island.
I don't care\#if the desert is\#in the way, I'll\#walk the miles.
Anything to\#get away\#from here.
Closed gate.
Oh,\. sorry.
Here,\. let\#me get\#that for you.
Come on through.
Can't believe\#those Bad\#boys are\#almost gone.
Maybe the\#Franchise is\#actually doing\#us some favors.
They do\#need some\#better fashion\#sense,\. though.
That tacky\#sportswear just\#won't cut it.
Perhaps we\#can give them\#some pointers?
I was here\#when John Johnson\#first established\#this gang.
You should\#have seen the\#state of "The\#Game" before him.
So drab!\|\#Absolutely no\#swagger to\#any of it!
JJ fixed\#that issue\#right quick.
As a group,\.\#our sense of\#fashion is our\#bedrock of unity.
Our sportswear\#connects us all\#like a knot\#of beating hearts!
I've grown\#fond of the\#Franchise style.
It's a\#look to\#DIE for.
Those jerseyheads\#wanna cramp our style.
But as long\#as Gold Diamond's\#on our side,\. they\#can't touch The Corps!
If they come\#'round here,\. we'll\#make 'em all\#taste the dirt.
The Game\#had no pizazz\#before John J.
Everything was\#tacky and boring.
What good is\#bloodshed without\#some flair to it?
That Gold\#Diamond really\#set things straight.
Who knew\#red,\. green,\.\#and gold went\#so well together?
The Franchise\#was onto\#something\#all along!
I feel\#fresh as\#a spring breeze.
We've got\#this Game\#in the bag.
The other\#gangs might as\#well give up.
The Corps\#stays winning.
Not even\#the Franchise\#can change that.
Gold Diamond\#put crowns on\#our heads and\#said "here be kings."
Now even\#the lowliest\#chump can\#be a monarch.
This is\#what it means\#to be with\#The Corps.
We are kings,\.\#and Downtown\#is our throne.
One Franchise,\.\#infinite kings!
We can\#all be rulers\#of our own\#destiny!
You won't\#get this freedom\#anywhere else.
Don the\#jersey and\#embrace a\#new world!
He gave you an Infinity Jersey.
Infinite kings!\|\#An unending rule!
We'd like to\#get through,\. please.
Hmm...
You've got\#the Brand.
Are you\#a new member?
Um...\| yes.
That's cool.
Here,\. let me\#raise the gate.
Have fun.
The Corps\#will treat\#you right.
Sorry, but\#this is Corps\#territory.
Only gang\#members are\#allowed passage.
Come back\#when you've\#got some\#bling on you.
Seems like\#you've picked\#up some style.
That's what\#we like\#to see.
I suppose I'll\#let you in.
Enjoy yourself.
The fun\#times might\#not last\#for long.
You still\#don't have\#the stuff.
No King,\.\#no entry.
Gate's open.\.\#What are you\#waiting for?
Head inside.
That chef\#bastard needs\#to come on\#out here.
I didn't\#climb this hill\#to get stiffed\#by a fence!
If this\#is his idea\#of a joke,\.\#I'm not laughing.
Shef's a\#wily one,\.\#I tell ya.
Took nearly\#five percent of\#our land just\#by himself.
It's every\#jersey's dream\#to get a chance\#at that fight.
Too bad\#he doesn't\#seem to share\#our sentiments.
The boy\#that takes off\#his head will be\#crowned a king.
Coward ain't\#ain't even here.
We was\#set up from\#the start.
Guess I'll\#have to find\#some other\#bitch to butcher.
All I\#want is\#one good\#fight.
That'd be\#more than\#The Game\#ever got me.
The thrill\#of battle\#is calling\#my name.
"No Entry"
"Shef's Space"
Don't let\#his goofy hat\#fool you.
That man\#is a monster.
There's a\#reason he got\#that turf all\#by himself.
I told them\#Shef doesn't\#play by the rules.
But they\#wouldn't listen.
Sooner or\#later they'll\#come to\#accept it.
Pulled something from the meat.
A bloody cleaver!
Limbs jut out from the pile.
The smell is gut-wrenching.
They have all been eviscerated.
The meat pulses with green.
15 Magazines!
Cocola Cola!
You're not\#supposed to\#be here...
Well, we'll\#get out of\#your hair,\. then.
Just let\#us pass.
The cycle of\#violence spins\#'round and 'round.
This spiral of\#blood will paint\#Downtown with\#sanguine glory.
And the\#blood...\| will\#be on\#our hands.
Okay,\. but\#can we\#go now?
I see\#how it is.\.\#Ignore me, then.
The cycle\#will catch\#up with\#you, too.
What we're\#planning goes\#beyond "The Game."
The Dynamite\#Mafia will never\#be the same.
Found an exotic knife!
The fuck?\.\#Who are you?
How did you\#get down here?
I fell,\.\#mostly.
What are you\#doing in this\#super secret\#super hideout?!
Why are\#you asking\#me so many\#questions?
I'm just\#curious...
Curiosity\#killed the\#cat,\. they say.
Well,\. I'm\#not a cat,\.\#but curosity did\#take my arms.
I swear\#it didn't\#look like\#a landmine.
I thought\#it was just\#a...\| really\#small manhole.
I miss\#my arms...
When the\#'ell are we\#goin' up top?
Ah've been\#ready to go\#for ages now!
We're gonna\#bust up those\#Bad twats for\#good this time.
Tic Tonic\#will finally\#take back\#"The Game!"
Do we\#know how\#many are left?
Can't be more\#than a few\. Jerseys\#have cleared out\#most of 'em by now.
I need a\#definitive number.\.\#Did that scout\#come back yet?
Figures as much.\|\#You can't trust\#Kamil with anything.
I'll give\#him an hour.
You think\#skullface will\#wait that long?
Probably not,\.\#but it's fun\#to wager.
That it is.
If this\#gig works out,\.\#the Mafia will\#be back on top.
And if\#it doesn't?
We'll at\#least be better\#off than those\#Bureaucrats.
Never liked\#those suits.
Imagine being\#an office worker\#in this day and age.
I'd die\#of boredom.
Ah ha ha...
I've devised a\#genius plan to\#take back the turf\#those Angels stole!
What exactly\#does that entail?
We pop\#out of the\#ground and\#beat them up!
They'll never\#see it coming!
My first idea\#was to send them\#a box with a\#pipe bomb in it.
But apparently\#that's "against\#the rules."
Psh!\. Like\#Tic Tonic's ever\#cared about rules!
Recipes for various explosives are\#written here on this paper.
I feel\#like we're\#getting ahead\#of ourselves.
Is it really\#a good idea\#to play at\#a time like this?
And with\#this plan, too...
I wonder\#if my brother\#would feel the\#same way.
I don't know\#if I paid enough\#attention to the\#mission briefing.
Skullface is\#just...\. so\#hard to\#listen to.
Now I'm\#unprepared for\#my part in\#the plan...
Dicks.
My nerves\#are killin' me.
I just\#want to get\#this whole\#thing over with...
Whew,\. what\#a workout!
Javelin tossing\#does wonders\#for your core!
Oh, bullshit.\.\#I don't feel\#any stronger\#than I was before.
Figures,\. you\#could barely\#chuck a pole\#five feet!
Shut up!\. I just\#forgot to drink\#my milk this\#morning, that's all.
Next time,\.\#you can choose\#our exercise.
I will,\.\#smartypants.
At least\#I have\#a pair.
I got\#him there.
The Corps\#is all about\#physical aptitude.
We work\#out every day\#to hone our\#bodies and minds.
Some of\#us could afford\#to work a\#little harder.
God,\. you're\#a prick.
It's just\#been an\#off day\#for me.
You should\#see me when\#I really get going.
Get going\#on our\#jerky stash.
Ugh!\.\#Leave me\#alone!
He had\#it coming.
How's that\#for a workout,\.\#asswipe?
Actually,\. goring\#fools is good\#for your core.
I think I'll\#work this\#into my routine...
That mystery\#man spouts\#nothing but lies!
There is\#no City,\. and\#there is\#no future!
All we\#have left\#is "The Game."
When that bird\#gets taken off\#the air,\. who\#will they listen to?
We need\#Gold Diamond\#to lead us\#to victory!
As if things\#couldn't get any\#more boring.
At least the\#talkshow guy\#was funny.
This is\#just a bunch\#of flashing lights.
Bunch of\#God damn numbers.
Is it too\#much to ask\#for a little\#entertainment?
Huh,\. is it,\. God?
There we go.
Now I can\#go back to\#mindlessly staring\#at this fat guy.
He is staring absentmindedly.
Man...\| I was\#really enjoying\#that talkshow.
It got\#me to think.\.\#That almost never\#happens nowadays.
I crave\#that kind of\#philosophical\#stimulation...
Our sense of\#morality is worth\#being questioned\#in these times.
That talkshow man\#is really breaking\#the mold we've\#come to accept.
Yesss,\. it's\#back on!
Time for\#more stimulation!
Get the\#fuck away\#from me.
He is watching intently.
Turns out,\.\#morality is\#a farce.
We're all\#just meat.
Meat on\#the inside,\.\#meat on\#the outside.
It's a\#shame I never\#realized before now.
Fuck that talkshow.
The Franchise\#is the only\#philosophy\#that matters.
You know what?
I think\#this is\#actually better.
It's just\#some still images,\.\#but at least\#it's nonintrusive.
I could\#get my\#vibes on\#to this.
He is watching closely.
Oh,\. come\#the fuck on.
It was just\#getting good,\. too...
I'm pissed.
To whoever\#fixed this shit:\|\#fuck your mom.
God damned\#Kindchild...
Always hated\#that fat fuck,\.\#even before\#he got the jersey.
Now look\#what's happened.
The only way to\#get our TV back\#would be to fiddle with\#that satellite way up top.
But fuck\#if I'm gonna\#make that\#trip right now.
Guess I'll\#just sit\#and be sad.
Sigh...\|\#so sad.
Guess some\#crows must've\#chewed on the\#wires or something.
Whatever happened,\.\#I'm just glad this\#shit is fixed now.
He is staring blankly.
You know,\.\#I think he\#raises a\#fair point.
About what?
About our\#morality.
Why is it\#that when society\#goes under,\. all\#we can do is fight?
Where did our\#peace go?\. Why\#are we consumed\#by violence?
It's just a\#talkshow,\. man.
You're looking\#way too\#deep into it.
Come on!\.\#He's clearly\#trying to\#tell us something.
Yeah.\| He's\#telling us\#to change\#the channel.
'Cause this\#is boring\#as fuck.
I wish\#there was\#something\#better on...
What the hell?
Did someone\#trip on a wire?
Oh,\. son of a-!
DAMN YOU,\.\#KINDCHILD!
Ay, friend.\.\#Care for\#a toss?
Never heard\#of Gorodki?
Is that...\.\#some kind\#of food?
Ah ha ha...\|\#Oh,\. you\#Americans are\#so simple.
Okay,\. but\#that doesn't\#explain what\#you're talking about.
It's alright.\|\#You probably\#wouldn't be\#interested anyway.
This country\#is so fascinating.
Shame about\#that whole\#"Cold War"\#fiasco.
See that\#bitch over there?
All day,\#every day,\.\#he stands there\#and flaps his lips.
Ugh, he's\#so annoying.
Why are\#you standing\#so close to\#him, then?
Because...
I need to\#make sure he\#hasn't STOPPED\#being annoying.
Wouldn't want\#something like that\#to happen while\#I'm not watching.
One day that\#mouth of his\#will get him\#into trouble.
I guarantee it...
Oh, am\#I late?
Those silly\#boys started\#having fun\#without me!
Dear me,\.\#dearie me!
I have to\#learn how to\#get my "rear\#in gear,"\. as they say.
Tee hee...\|\#Where did\#I get my\#lipstick?
Well,\. it's\#actually blood.
Not mine,\#of course!\.\#That'd be\#quite improper.
I just\#couldn't take\#it anymore.
I was...\|\#too annoyed.
I'm going\#to rid this\#world of all\#annoying people.
This is\#the power\#the Franchise\#gives to me.
More than\#the Corps\#ever did.
The others\#think we're safe.
They think\#a shitty gate\#will save them\#from death.
But I can\#tell just how\#vulnerable\#we really are.
When the Franchise\#comes barging in,\.\#I'm not going\#to go down quietly.
You can\#bet your\#sweet ass\#on it.
Not such\#an easy\#target,\. now\#was I?
Dumbass\#jerseyheads.
This is\#a starting\#pistol by\#the way.
Don't ask\#me how it\#killed him.
No more\#phones,\. no\#more lifelines.
Downtown has\#been completely\#cut off from the\#rest of Olathe.
Now we\#can play\#our game\#in peace.
Spill our\#blood in peace.
The sweet blood...
It tastes\#so good...
It will\#be your turn,\.\#sooner or later...
Yo,\. some\#fat guy just\#like,\. totally\#ran past me.
I definitely\#could've stopped\#him,\. but...
My legs\#are sore.
Real bad\#legache over here.
Can barely\#even walk,\.\#that's how\#sore they are.
Wack shit.
Maybe when\#I feel better,\.\#I'll go after him.
But,\| it's\#gonna be\#a while.
It's a\#hard life,\.\#I tell ya.
First it was\#football,\. then it\#was basketball,\.\#and now tennis...
I might\#have to\#face the facts...
I'm really\#bad at sports.
Some golden\#boy I am...
Looks like\#I've...\| really\#caused a\#racket this time...
I should've\#gone into\#standup instead.
Out of gas.
Going somewhere,\.\#little, little man?
I'm getting tired\#of being held up\#by random bozos\#for no reason.
Whatever you\#want,\. go ahead\#and spell it out.
Heh,\. he's\#awfully feisty\#for a grandpa!
Oh,\. I'm sorry.
I didn't\#realize you\#were so sleepy.
Here...\|\#we'll help\#you get\#some rest.
That was...\|\#incredible!
A fine\#match if\#I say\#so myself!
Definitely not\#what I expected...
Go on, friend.
Thank you\#for the fight.
Yeah,\|\#thanks.
Never would I have\#thought that an old\#man could so fearsome!
You're making\#me sound like\#I'm halfway\#into a coffin.
I'm not\#THAT old.
Whatever you\#say,\. old timer.
I'm the\#champ now!
Ha ha HA!
Gimme my belt!
"Welcome Back to Mack"
The silo is firmly sealed.
Farming tools.
A watering can and some fertilizer.
Pluck a carrot?
Them crops\#ain't for\#just takin'!
Got a Rooty Carrot!
Pulling this out of the ground\#would probably be very difficult.
Boarded entryway.
It's sealed with a rusty lock.
Used the Mack Key.
Crops ain't\#lookin' too\#hot this year.
The soil\#in Downtown\#just ain't what\#it used to be.
But that's alright.\|\#Daddy Mack will\#know what to do.
He's gotten\#us through\#tougher times\#than these.
I bet those\#jerseyheads have\#somethin' to do\#with the crops dyin'.
That bunch's like\#a bad omen.
Ain't nothin'\#good can come\#outta them.
Everything's goin'\#south for us\#Mack kids.
Our crops\#are dying',\.\#meat's pilin'\#up to our knees...
And now\#we've done\#lost the key\#to the Mack Shack.
It's just\#one thing\#after another.
How long'll\#it be 'till those\#jerseys come\#stormin' through, too?
I hope\#Daddy Mack\#can get us\#through this.
He's always\#got a plan\#cookin' in that\#big head of his...
Jersey scarecrow.
Acquired Mystery Jerky!
It reeks of meat.
Acquired Stew in a Bag!
Ruined estate.
Old tractor.
Old tractor. The engine is missing.
Old tractor. The wheels\#were changed recently.
Combine, too rusty to function.
All this\#meat lyin'\#around's stinkin'\#to high hell.
When is someone\#gonna take the\#rake and scoop\#that shit up?
What's stoppin'\#you from doin'\#that yerself,\. dickhead?
'Cause...
Ya gonna\#finish that\#there thought?
Yup. Knew it.
Huck,\. why's\#you so mean\#to me all\#the damn time?
'Cause you\#dumb as hell.
But we're\#brothers!
That don't\#mean nothin'.
Never meant\#nothin' to\#Pappy,\. anyway...
Let's not\#talk about that.
I can\#talk about\#whatever the\#hell I want.
You're a jackass.
I'm gonna\#get back\#to work now.
Good.\. Make\#yerself useful\#for once.
Fuck you,\. Huck.
Fuck you,\. Glenn.
Looks like\#we got us\#some fresh meat!
The hell\#do you think\#is fresh about\#an old man?
Meat is\#meat,\. so\#long as\#it breathes!
Whatever, just\#get 'em!
Hmm...\|\#Wheat's all\#fucked up.
What?\. Why?
Hell if\#I know,\#just is.
That ain't good!
If the\#wheat don't\#grow,\. what're\#we gonna eat?
We'll be fine.
Got enough\#stored up to\#feed the whole\#damn town.
And if\#that ain't\#enough...
Maybe we'll\#put meat on\#the menu.
You can't\#grow meat,\.\#dumbfuck!
It was\#a metaphor\#you piece'a\#rat shit.
What's a metaphor?
You wouldn't\#understand if\#I told ya.
You callin'\#me stupid?
I hate you.
Feelin's mutual.
Bitch.
Bastard.
This harvest\#won't last\#us the year.
If it keeps\#this up,\. we'll\#be done for.
Our stores\#aren't holdin'\#up as well\#as we hoped...
Bless us,\.\#Momma Mack.
Keep us fed...
...'fore we\#all eat\#ourselves alive.
Farmin's hard\#work,\. I tell ya.
Don't help\#that the soil\#here ain't good\#for nothin'.
Gotta keep\#goin', though.
Downtown'll be\#toast without\#this next harvest.
Hey!\.\#You messin'\#with our\#farm, dipstick?!
No,\. I'm just\#passing through.
You better.
Ain't got no\#more patience\#for troublemakers\#'round these parts.
'Specially with\#these jersey\#knuckleheads\#runnin' amok.
You'll be plum\#fucked if I catch\#you messin' 'round\#with our crops.
Junker.
It's displaying various areas of the town.
Blindingly green.
He's sound asleep.
The townsfolk\#here are some\#interesting people.
This "Game"\#they're playing...
Do you suppose\#it could be\#a worthwhile\#business venture?
Maybe.
We're not\#in the right\#place to\#be picky.
Desparate sales\#for desparate buyers.
Sounds like\#a handsome\#investment\#to me.
Senseless violence\#is an untapped market.
We'll milk\#these people\#for everything\#they're worth.
We've been\#skirting the\#edge of bankrupcy\#for years now.
We need\#some revenue\#before we\#lose everything.
Relax,\. Lancaster.
It's only\#a matter of\#time before\#we hit it big.
Wall Street\#veterans like\#us always come\#out on top.
Don't count\#your chickens\#before they\#hatch,\. Gordon.
To think,\. we\#used to be\#sipping cocktails\#with Richard Nixon.
Those damn\#communists cost\#us everything.
I had a\#long talk with a\#fellow businessman.
Turns out,\#the Infinity\#Franchise is\#on the rise.
And I'm gonna\#ride the red\#line all the\#way to the top.
This is\#the investment\#I've been\#waiting for.
Indeed,\. patience\#is a tool of\#the prosperous...
Gaze upon\#me now,\#great sage.
See the\#carnage I\#have wrought.
The blood\#that drips from\#my hands...
It has\#become a\#part of me.
As inseparable\#as the lungs\#in my chest.
When the\#angel of death\#comes, it will\#sing my name.
Serenade me,\.\#o angel of death...
Legend has\#it that there\#are worlds\#beyond our own.
Realms past the\#deepest abyss and\#through the thickest\#fogs of mystery.
Can we\#humans even\#comprehend\#such places?
Should you\#find yourself\#in a plane\#beyond the Earth...
...I suggest\#you leave\#as soon\#as possible.
Some things\#are better\#off unknown.
Madness is\#sure to come\#to those who\#seek the truth.
Sometimes,\. it's\#almost too easy.
After your\#first heads,\.\#killing ain't\#even a struggle.
But it\#ain't fun,\.\#neither.
It's just blood.
I guess we'll\#all be blood\#in the end.
You wanna\#hear a joke?
My political\#science degree.
It'd be funny\#if it wasn't so sad.
Before The Game,\.\#I felt like a\#useless old man\#waiting for death.
But Otto and\#all the others\#gave my life\#purpose again.
I'm not\#much for\#the brutality\#of it all, but...
The schemes?\.\#The board meetings?\.\#The toilet cleanings?
I live\#for those.
The last\#meeting we had,\#Otto even brought\#in some donuts!
They were\#stale and slightly\#moldy, but still!
Donuts, in this\#day and age!
A bloody\#sight for\#sore eyes.
Otto still\#isn't back\#from that\#meeting.
I'm starting\#to get nervous...
What if...\|\#he doesn't\#come back?
That's preposterious.
Otto will\#be back;\.\#we just need\#to be patient.
If you\#say so...
We better\#throw him one\#ripper of a\#return party.
Him and\#Lenny both.
I'm on\#the lookout\#for jerseyheads.
Seen any?
A few.
Killed any?
.\..\..\.A few.
Damn freaks\#are ruining\#The Game\#with their antics.
Otto's got\#a plan.
He'll make\#sure things\#are taken\#care of right.
Rusty mailbox.
Say...\| have you\#noticed it getting\#a little\. loud\.\#inside the Bureau?
Afraid I wouldn't\#know, Adrian.
Your ears\#work better\#than mine.
Perhaps this calls\#for a little...\|\#investigation.
Eh, they're\#probably fine.
If you're\#looking for\#Otto,\. he's\#not here.
No telling when\#he'll be back.
That meeting's\#liable to\#last for ages...
Oh,\. and don't\#even think about\#breaking into his office.
It's locked\#up tighter\#than Fort Knox.
And I swallowed\#the key, so...
Gonna be at least\#a couple hours before\#anyone gets inside.
Now that I\#think about it,\.\#I hope Otto\#takes his time.
Was that sound\#I heard behind me\#the sound of Otto's\#office being infiltrated?
Oh,\. alright.
Checked the trash can.
Ten rotten fruits!
Nothing else useful.
How long\#until the\#coffee is done?
Hmph, impatient\#as always,\. Francis!
No,\. it's\#just been\#half an hour\#and I'm getting-\^
You'll see\#some day, my\#young ward...
You'll see\#that waiting\#things out\#has its benefits!
Oh my God...
Does everything\#have to be\#a lesson with you?
There are\#always opportunities\#to learn,\. my boy!
I'm not\#even young.
I'm forty-six\#God damn\#years old.
Still a spring\#chicken to me!
Oh ho ho!
NO MORE!
That is the\#LAST fucking time\#I hear about\#God damn STOCKS!
I just wanted\#some fucking coffee!
Just HAD to\#do this the\#hard way,\. eh,\#Wallace?!
Cheap bastard...
Francis,\. have I\#ever told you\#about my days\#as a stock trader?
Yes.\|\#Multiple times.
Well, maybe\#you've lapsed\#on some of\#the details.
I'll tell\#the story\#once more.
Please, I've\#heard it enough.\.\#Just tell me\#when the coffee is-\^
It all started\#with a little\#farm in Kentucky...
...and while I\#was in New York,\.\#I came across\#this nice girl.
She knew\#everything there\#was to know\#about microeconomics.
Wait,\. when\#did this happen?
I swear you\#make up new\#details every\#time you go off.
My memory's\#just a bit\#hazy, Francis.
Now,\. as\#I was saying...
He is rambling.
Instant coffee!
Nothing else inside.
Coffee is being brewed.
Someone drank it all.
There's nothing on.
"Oliver Ottoman\#---\#Master of Economics"
Someone's desk.
Some sort of iron ruler.
Old government documents.
Textbooks on international trade.
Spare Tie!
Ey, you\#seen dat\#Long Leg\#freak 'round here?
Can't say\#I have.
Bastard borrowed\#my other club\#and hasn't given\#it back yet.
Swear,\. next\#time I see\#him I'll crack\#his ankles open.
You'd best\#be careful,\#talkin' 'bout\#Lenny like that.
Especially right\#outside his office.
Guy's a\#monster.
Psh,\. ain't\#nothin' outta\#my league.
Only takes\#one whack to\#da kneecaps,\.\#and pa-blooey.
Not such\#a tall order\#no more.
Uh huh,\.\#sure...
I'll have ya know\#dat I hold da world\#record for most holes-in-one\#in one game'a golf.
And how\#many holes\#would that be?
Why do you\#need to know?
I don't,\.\#but I wanna\#make sure\#you're bein' truthful.
What,\. don't\#trust me?
Well fuck\#you den.
Ain't gonna\#tell ya anyway.
My golf\#prowess is\#unparalleled.
Swear on\#my momma's\#husband's ex-\#girlfriend's cat.
Guess I hold\#anotha world\#record now.
"Most holes\#clubbed into\#one fool's\#sorry head."
Tell the\#boys over at\#Guinness to\#write this down.
Wonder if\#we'll have a\#board meetin'\#when Otto gets back.
Fuckin' hope\#not.\. They're\#borin' as shit.
That's just\#'cause you\#ain't never\#paid attention.
I ain't never\#paid attention 'cause\#they're borin' as shit.
Pah, your loss.
Otto's a\#modern-day\#Socrates,\. I\#tell ya.
Sock-ra-who?
Fuggedaboutit.
Got a Businessy Fedora!
Old newspaper clipping.
A feasibility report on the\#efficacy of reusable toilet paper.
Dry as a desert.
Janitor's tools.
Take a cup of water?
Got a cup of water!
Old plastic cups.
Sometimes,\.\#I miss the\#old days.
The old\#wars and\#the old\#struggle.
At least\#it had purpose.
The Game,\.\#the Franchise...\|\#they are equally\#meaningless.
I miss her...
The cold\#touch of the\#Motherland.
May it\#live forever\#in my heart.
My poor\#daughter...
I see\#her in my\#dreams,\.\#sometimes.
Her sweet face...
Every once\#in a while,\.\#I'll even hear\#her speaking.
I can\#never tell\#what she's\#saying, but...
I know\#she must\#be calling\#out to me.
Literature\#is a lost\#art form.
No one\#appreciates\#a good book\#nowadays.
You certainly wouldn't\#see any of those\#Bad idiots sitting\#down for a read.
I bet a\#shiny nickle\#that Fringe Boy\#is illegible.
What are\#you reading,\.\#anyway?
Oh, one\#of my\#favorites.
Playboy\|: A History.
He is absorbed by the text.
Turns out\#books are\#great for\#bludgeoning,\. too.
Food for the\#mind and for\#the ravenous body.
What more\#could you\#ask for?
Dusty phonebook.
Mounds of paperwork.
Book of black magic.
Allegedly.
Tax returns piled high.
Throne for the vertically-inclined.
A collection of letters, yet to be opened.
Lists of names, among other papers.
The papers have been smeared with blood.
He's staring off vacantly.
This the\#satellite those\#golden boys\#were talkin' about?
Looks like it.
Nah,\. this\#could be\#anyone's giant\#satellite.
Think they'd\#appreciate it\#if we fixed\#it up for them?
Uh...\| probably?
What are\#you getting at?
I don't\#like where\#this is going.
This shouldn't\#be too hard.
Hey, wait\#just a\#second,\. Lucky.

You'd be\#right,\. but I\#think I've got\#it figured ou-\^

That's what you\#get for sticking a\#fork in an electical\#outlet, HA HA!
Alex's body was filled with a strange power.
Learned Thunder Palm!
You probably shouldn't touch this again.
Cars are wedged into the tunnel.
Checked one of the trunks.
Found a secret stash!
The van is full of magazines.
Hey, man,\.\#hands off\#the pages!
Gonna need\#those in a\#minute now...
15 magazines!
Nothing but junk.
Just my\#fuckin' luck...
Van broke down\#right as I was\#about to leave\#this jank-ass town.
Now I'm\#stuck between\#a rock and\#a hard place.
Do I walk\#from here,\. or\#do I try to\#fix the junker?
At this point,\.\#I dunno if I\#still trust my\#own two feet.
Maybe I'll\#just sit here,\.\#wait for someone\#else to pass by.
Someone with\#a car, I mean.
I gotta get\#out of this\#looney bin...
Just a rock.
You fixin'\#to head up\#Sweet Breeze Trail?
Is that\#where this\#highway leads?
Be careful\#climbin' 'round\#that mountain.
Place is\#crawlin' with\#jersey freaks.
I see.\.\#Thanks for\#the heads-up.
I tell ya,\.\#that mountain\#ain't what it\#used to be.
Though, I guess\#nothin' really\#is anymore.
I need to get\#out of this crazy\#town before I get\#mashed into hamburger.
Fuck The Game,\.\#it's not\#worth playing.
If only\#any of these\#shitty cars\#actually worked...
Too bad\#I gave up\#on that\#engineering degree.
Lost his head.
Completely crushed.
Friendly invitation.
I tell ya,\.\#seeing all this\#violence makes\#your head woozy.
It's like\#a mirage...
Stare into\#the blood long\#enough and all\#you'll see is red.
Deep,\| dark red.
I'm starting\#to feel\#different.
Body's tingling,\.\#eyes itchy.
Real unpleasant feelings.
Listen, chum.
I appreciate\#your company.
But if you\#ever see me\#again,\. be wary.
I might not\#be the same\#man I am now.
Ah,\. I can\#smell it.
Fire...\|\#sweet fire.
20 Magazines!
This stereo is emitting a peculiar sound.
Found a strange stereo!
Shattered chariot.
Yo,\. old guy!

Semi-truck crushed like a can.
Those Gold Diamond\#dickheads stole my spray\#can and chucked it\#into the salt lake.
My last can...

Returned the spray can.
Oh,\. my\#poor can!
I thought\#you would\#be lost forever!
I can't\#thank you\#enough, Mr. Rags.
Um,\. why\#don't you\#take this\#in exchange?
Got a small key!
If I'm not\#mistaken,\. this\#belongs to the\#Mack family.
I would have returned\#it myself,\. but their farm\#is across Corps territory.
There's no\#way I'm setting\#foot in that\#golden nightmare.
Perhaps you'll\#have more\#luck, though.
Finally,\. I\#can get\#back to bombing!
Metaphorically.
I don't think\#I'll be sticking\#around this Alley\#for much longer, though.
Not while\#these Corps chumps\#are still kicking.
Maybe I'll\#head up\#the mountain.
I've heard\#it's nice there.
Small key!
Plane crash.
My dentist\#is going to\#be upset\#with me...
I don't\#even like\#bowling.
Iced coffee and perfume!

Take a\#load off,\.\#stranger.
Sweet Breeze\#is a place\#of relaxation.
A little patch\#of nature untouched\#by the modern man.

Well,\. I can't\#make no guarantees.
Me and my\#pop used to\#run the hotel\#on the mountain peak.
"Sweet Breeze Hotel,"\.\#an escape from\#the woes of man.
I was planning\#on letting my son\#take over the biz\#after he grew up,\. but...
Well,\| you\#know things\#didn't go\#right for us.
That whole place\#has long since\#been defunct.
Just a bunch\#of jerseys holed\#up in there now.

Specially with\#the kiddies.
Ol' Jeremy\#Denkins would\#take 'em hikin'\#up the cliffsides.

Ah, just\#in time.
You performed\#excellently during\#your last visit.
Your last\#visit ended\#a little...\|\#awkwardly.
But that's okay.
At this\#point, you\#have about...
Twenty-four kills!
That means...
You have\#reached the\#"second fold\#to infinity"!
You've really\#been getting into\#the Franchise spirit!
That's what\#we like to see.
Now you are eligible\#to strive for the third\#fold at forty-eight kills.

Still no jersey?
I have a\#spare in my\#desk if you-\^

Who are\#you people?
What's the\#end goal here?
Is this all\#some sort of\#sick game?
Oh ho ho.
I assure you,\#Mr. Churchland,\.\#the Infinity\#Franchise is no game.
Now,\. just\#one more\#formality.
Kill the\#avatar of\#your failure.
Are...\| are you?
I'm exactly\#who you\#think I am.
It's been\#a long time.

All that\#matters is\#your present.
Now, come.

Fantastic work, Alex.
I will see\#you again soon.
This is insane.
Whoever you\#are,\. I've had enough.
Stop this madness.
Oh, Alex.
You will\#come to see\#eventually.
None of\#this is\#MY doing.
You feel different.\#ATK increased. AGI increased.
Oo, tough luck.
I'm sure\#you'll do\#better next time.
Pah.
Some pupil\#you were.
Those Corps\#losers kicked\#me outta their club.
But I\#don't need 'em!
Not when\#the Franchise's\#got my back.
So what if\#I happened to\#kick a man so\#hard his neck broke?
Sucker just\#couldn't handle\#my moves!
Seems like\#I've gotten\#you interested.
How about\#a firsthand\#demonstration,\.\#old man?
Too hot\#for ya?
Maybe you\#should get outta\#the kitchen,\. gramps!
This is\#a world\#of men, now...

Some of these\#other guys can\#kill like it's what\#they were born to do.
I can barely\#leave a bruise\#on most people...
Maybe I\#should ask\#for help.
Get some of\#the high folders\#to show me\#the ropes.
Think that\#would work?
They'd probably\#just kill you.
Fuck, you're right.
I've got\#my work\#cut out\#for me...
So dere I\#was,\. at da\#market,\. lookin' for\#a pack of smokes.
When all of\#da sudden, this\#joickass comes\#tromping up.
And I says\#to 'em,\. "whaddya\#what, pallie?"
And he says\#back to me,\.\#"ya face is\#ugly as fuck."
So I do what\#any rational man\#would do and\#gouge his eyes out.
'Cause if I'M\#ugly,\. then buddy,\.\#you might as well\#not be seein' anything.
And so dat's\#how I ended\#up doin' ten\#years hard time.
Who are\#you talking to?
Hell does\#it look like\#I'm talkin' to?
But yeah,\. some\#real fuckin' rude\#people in this\#world, I tell ya.
All I\#see is\#fire.
All I\#smell is\#smoke.
God,\. how\#I want it\#all to\#burn away.
Flame,\|\#dear flame...
Friend,\. why\#is it that you\#embrace conflict?
Why have\#you rejected\#peace for a\#life of turmoil?
Please...\.\. put\#down your\#weapons.
I can pour\#you a cup\#of tea if\#you like.
...Augh...
Meeeaaaaaat...
So captivated\#by carnage they\#can scarcely even\#speak anymore.
Ah!\. Someone\#yet untouched\#by this red and\#green madness!
Please, friend,\.\#help me convince\#this unruly man\#to step aside.
He is blocking\#the path to\#my yoga studio.
Help the man?
.\..\..\.Sure.
Just a moment.
Mmm...\. quite\#the performance.
Thank you\#for the aid,\#good sir.
It's no\#problem.
Call me Milo,\.\#the "Yoga Master."
It's been\#some time\#since anyone\#sane has arrived.
I was starting\#to itch for a little\#extra company.
Do come\#and join me\#up in my\#studio.
I'll pour\#some tea\#for you and\#your friends.
.\..\..\.Sorry,\. but\#I'd rather\#not get\#involved.
Oh...\.\. really?
Well,\. that\#is quite alright.
I suppose\#I will just\#deal with\#this mysel-\^
Well now,\.\#that was a\#quick reaction.
I was starting\#to itch for a\#little extra company.
Do come\#and join me\#up in\#my studio.
"YOU ARE HERE:\|\#SWEET BREEZE YOGA"
"SWEET BREEZE YOGA"
"As we all know, life in modern\#Olathe can be more than stressful.
"During times like these, everyone could\#use an opportunity to decompress and\#find the peace within themselves.
"That is precisely what was on the mind of\#Mikhail Zhnebrowski when he established his\#yoga studio here in Sweet Breeze Park.
"Mr. Zhnebrowski has graciously opened his\#studio for public use, so if you ever need to\#clear your mind, come roll out a mat, put on\#your yoga pants, and be one with the universe.
"NOTICE: Must have at least one arm\#and one leg to participate in yoga."
Scrambled crow egg!
Huh?\.\#Out already?
Don't tell\#me I missed\#the whole talk!
Afraid\#you did.
Damn!
Oh well!
If that yoga guy\#really wanted me to\#stay,\. he would've got\#some better chairs!
HAHA!
The hell\#do you think\#YOU'RE going?
Uh...\| up?
Wrong!\. You're\#going DOWN,\.\#motherfuckers!
They say Arnold\#has been killing\#nonstop for three weeks.
Does he\#even sleep?
Fuck if\#I know.
I just hope\#he doesn't come\#around here.
I could\#probably take him.
You're a\#fuckin' dunce.
You look good\#enough to eat\#for three days\#and three nights.
And that's\#just your head.
Better move\#along before\#I get hungry...
Those shithead\#campers think\#they're sittin' pretty\#in their little camp!
But I have\#the advent of\#RANGED WEAPONRY!
I will\#rain flint-y\#hell upon\#them all!
I'm cool\#as they come...
Like an\#iceberg...\| chunky.
Too bad I\#ain't got no\#hottie to share\#this chunk with.
Would you believe\#me if I told you\#I lost my last can\#of green spray?
I am a failure.
First The Game,\.\#now the Franchise...
I just can't\#stop losing...
Another challenger.
Another lamb\#to the slaughter.
You're that\#Rando soldier\#from Garbage Island.
I saw what\#you did to\#all of those guys.
Hmph.\| That\#was only\#the beginning.
I have become\#so much more.
Now I sit\#on the peak\#of carnage itself.
The crown\#of violence\#rests on my head.
And no one...\|\#no one can\#take it from me.
Enough prattle.
If it is\#blood you seek...
Then you\#have come\#to the\#right place.
Impressive.
Never would\#I have expected\#such strength from\#people like you.
But this\#isn't over yet.
Over a hundred\#men have tried and\#failed to end my life.
What makes\#you think\#you'll be\#any different?
No, it's going to\#take a lot more\#than that to kill m-\.\^
His head.
"YOU ARE HERE:\|\#SWEET BREEZE HOTEL"
"SWEET BREEZE HOTEL"
"The crown jewel of Sweet Breeze, this\#hotel was lovingly constructed by one\#Abraham Tellington in 1982."
"For a price so low that it will drop your jaw,\#you can stay at what is unquestionably the\#finest inn this side of Oklahoma."
"Enjoy a view so breathtaking that you'll need\#an oxygen tank just to see it, and experience\#service so sweet it will rot your teeth away!"
"DISCLAIMER: Sweet Breeze Park is not\#liable for any asphyxiation or oral decay\#suffered while at Sweet Breeze Hotel.\#See the hotel policy guide for more details."
Crashed chopper.
It's a hard\#grind, folks.
But it\#pays off.
You won't find\#a view like this\#anywhere else.
On your\#way to\#challenge\#the big boy?
Good luck\#with that.
Man looks like\#he eats boulders\#for breakfast.
I may be\#a sociopath,\. but\#he's somethin' else.
Man,\. there is\#an absolute violence\#ORGY going on down there.
Wish I could be\#a part of that...
No one knows\#carnage like Arnold.
He will always\#reign supreme.
What a pretty\#place this is...
Dunno why so\#many of those\#chumps are stickin'\#with the city.
This mountain's\#where it's at.
See all\#those stars?
That's how many\#men I'll have killed\#by the end of this.
Buried gnome.
It's been locked.
Failed garden.
Skeleton.
Cash register.\. The key pad\#is suspiciously well-worn.
Try a combination?
A path opened underneath the register!
Well-kept gnome.
I just wanted\#to check out that\#campsite up ahead.
But apparently\#wearing a jersey\#is enough cause to\#justify an ass-beating!
I feel discriminated.
So much\#for those\#complementary\#smores...
Fuck that\#camp, man.
"Oh, don't\#go, Bill.\. We're\#safe as long\#as we stay here."
Please.
That's bullshit\#and a half.
I'm tired of\#lying around and\#pretending that things\#will eventually get better.
That ship sailed a\#loooooong time ago.
The other guys\#can sit on their\#asses as long\#as they like.
I'm getting the\#hell out of here\#while I'm still\#alive to do it.
I'm on guard\#for any members\#of that red and\#green scourge.
Already gave\#one of 'em a\#belting earlier.
Maybe with enough\#time,\. they'll learn that\#their bitch-asses aren't\#welcome on these grounds.

Alex
Joel
Cancel
Hm...\|\#Mr. Churchland,\.\#is it?
I can tell;\.\#your condition\#is quite critical.
But fear not.\.\#I will get your\#body back in\#working order.
Here,\. drink\#this tonic.
It will help\#your body ease\#up before the procedure.
.\..\..\.Alright.
Drank some weird tonic.
What is\#this stuff\#anyway?
It's bitter,\.\#and it's making\#my mouth numb.
Just a general\#anestheti-,\. I mean,\#magic elixer.
The full effect\#should be kicking\#in right about...
...now!
I'll,\. uh,\.\#be out\#here, Lucky.
Hm...\|\#Mr. Miller,\.\#is it?
Step into\#my chambers,\.\#wounded mortal.
Let me\#know how\#it goes,\. Joel.
Let's hope\#this don't\#take too long...
Thank you\#for waiting\#so patiently!
Here is\#your friend,\.\#all healed up.
Feeling better\#now, Joel?
I'm surprised.
I really\#do feel\#fixed up.
Maybe this\#Shaman's voodoo\#is the real deal\#after all...
Ha,\. was\#there ever\#any doubt?
...Well,\. I hope\#your body returns\#to peak condition\#soon, Mr. Miller.
Do return\#if anything\#else is amiss.
What a kook.
Guess it's\#back to\#the road\#for us.
Hmph,\. do\#not waste\#my time!
Come back\#if you have\#a real emergency.
Geen
Hm...\|\#Mr. Jean\.\#is it?
Make sure\#he treats\#you right,\. Geen.
Ah,\. don't\#sweat it.
This guy pulls\#anything funny,\. and\#he'll be the one\#who needs healing.
Feeling better\#now, Geen?
It's a\#damn\#miracle.
Feel better\#than the\#day I\#was born.
This guy's\#actually a\#wizard...
Ah ha ha,\. all of\#those hard years at\#shaman college\#must have paid off!
...Well,\. I hope\#your body returns\#to peak condition\#soon, Mr. Jean.
...Maybe he's\#got a few\#screws loose.
But isn't that\#the root of\#all genius?
Salt Crab
Hm...\|\#Mr. Crab\.\#is it?
You're quite the\#peculiar patient,\. but\#nothing I can't handle!
You okay\#with this,\. Salt?
Absolutely!
I've always wanted\#to be bewitched! HA HA!
You good, Salt?
I feel like\#a million bucks!
A million\#crispy,\#salty dollars!
I should participate\#in black magic\#more often! HA HA!
You're always\#welcome back,\.\#so long as you\#have some pages...
...Well,\. I hope\#your body returns\#to peak condition\#soon, Mr. Crab.
I love\#this guy!
He's gotta\#be a hoot\#at parties, HA HA!
You there!\.\#Come no closer!
Mortals,\. do you\#have any idea\#of before whom\#you now stand?
Your silence\#speaks volumes...
Behold!\| The\#glorious and\#esoteric form of...
...the mighty...\|\#Shaman of\#Sweet Breeze!
Uh...\| hi.
For what reason\#have you come\#here,\. mortals?
Well,\. we're\#travellers,\.\#heading east.
Ah,\. so you\#seek my blessing\#of good fortune, yes?
Not exactly-\^
Then blessed\#you shall be!
Watch now\#as I perform\#the sacred ritual\#dance of fortune!
Woo!\| Yeah!
Get blessed!\.\#Oh yeah!
GOOD FORTUNE\#COMES YOUR WAY!
Well?\| Are\#you feeling\#lucky now?
I...\| don't\#really feel\#anything.
I feel embarrassed.
I'm feelin' it!\.\#I like this\#guy's style,\. HA HA!
...Is there\#anything else\#you can do?
I'm glad\#you asked!
As it just so\#happens,\. I am famed\#for my miraculous\#healing abilities!
Now THAT\#sounds enticing.
Yeah...\| feels like\#we can't go five\#minutes without gettin'\#roughed up nowadays.
Whatever may so\#happen to ail you,\.\#I guarantee I can\#take care of it!
Even certain more...\|\#unsavory conditions...\|\#are not beyond\#my capabilities.
Head trauma,\.\#shattered bones,\.\#cardiac arrest...\|\#I can fix it all!
Through the power\#of witchcraft,\. I can\#heal every woe!
And it will\#only cost a small\#sum of one hundred\#dirty magazines!
You heard\#me right.
One hundred\#filthy ones,\. no\#more, no less.
That's just asinine!
Is it even\#possible to carry\#around that much?
Heh,\. you'd\#be surprised!
There's no\#way we can\#pay a price\#that high.
Mmm...\| then,\#my friends,\. you may\#perhaps be,\. as they\#say,\. "shit outta luck."
Well,\. my\#offer still stands.
If you are ever in the need\#of some emergency healing,\. and\#you happen to have the appropriate\#maggage,\. then come see me.
I will fix\#you up to the\#best of my\#magical ability.
What a quack!\#HA HA!
...You think\#he's legit,\. Joel?
For a price\#like that?\. Hell...
But I suppose\#we won't know\#unless we're ever\#that desperate.
Let's hope we\#don't get to\#that point, then.
Hey, Lucky.\.\#Feelin' better now?
You could\#say that.
I had an\#interesting conversation\#with our Shaman friend.
Oh?\| And what'd\#that amount to?
Huzzah!\. Once again\#my wonderous magic\#fixes a broken body!
You were\#wise to\#come here,\#mortals.
I,\. the Shaman\#of Sweet Breeze,\.\#have surely altered\#your disastrous fate.
And,\. uh...\| thanks\#for keeping all\#of this between us.
Yeah,\| of course.
Well,\. good luck\#on your journey!
And remember, I\#will always be here\#if you need me!
Such a\#weird guy.
At least\#he means well.
Yeah...\| suppose\#he could\#be worse.
So,\. shall\#we be off?
This camp is\#our safe haven.
Try as they\#might,\. those\#jerseyhead freaks\#can't get inside.
We'll wait out the\#apocalypse right here,\.\#in the comfort\#of our cabins.
While those in\#the city suffer,\.\#we remain calm\#and unharmed.
We need no\#walls of concrete\#to protect us.
Just the helping\#hands of Mother Nature.
Befriend the\#wilderness,\. and\#your blessings\#will be endless.
Anger it,\. and\#there will be no\#end to your misery.
There are\#many secrets to\#be discovered\#within the cliffs.
All you have\#to do is listen.
They say one\#man heard the\#trumpets within\#the cliffs.
The sirens\#that signal\#the end times.
Society laughed,\|\#until they were\#at the mercy\#of Armageddon.
The mountains of\#Olathe have been my\#home for nearly\#thirty years now.
The springwater\#practically runs\#in my blood.
I've climbed to the\#highest peaks and\#fought bears with my\#bare hands.\| And won.
So you can bet\#your raggedy ass that I\#won't let some jersey\#jocks be the death of me.
These trails\#have trained\#me well.
I may be\#old,\. but I am\#a survivor,\#damn it!
Locked tight.
No one's home!
Oh, me?\|\#I'm the\#ghost that\#haunts this cabin.
Definitely not\#the person\#who lives here.
You'll have\#to take my\#word for it!
Go on, now!
Can't you\#see that I'm\#busy...\| uh,\.\#haunting?
No response.
Uh,\. wrong number!
Please dial\#again after\#the beep!
Beeeep!
I have\#nothing you need.
Just leave\#us alone.
This mountain\#is so huge!
I'm looking\#up, but it\#just keeps\#getting higher!
Does it even\#have a peak?
Some of the\#adults say there's\#a big hotel way\#on up there.
Right at\#the tippy top.
Every once in\#a while I feel\#like I can see it.
But then I\#remember that I\#don't actually know\#what a hotel looks like.
Maybe when all\#the jersey guys\#go away,\. I'll try\#to finally find it.
Patty and I\#used to hang\#with some other\#kids down the trail.
We stayed at\#an old playground\#to get away from\#those jersey jerks.
But it was\#too boring just\#staying there,\. so\#we booked it.
I'm glad\#we found\#this camp.
I don't think\#we could've lasted\#too much longer\#on our own.
Those guys\#down there...
I hope\#they're okay.
God musta thought he\#was real funny when he\#took this slice of Hell\#and dumped it on Olathe.
There's enough blood\#here to make a\#vampire feel sick.
Real sick fuckin'\#joke this mountain is.
And I'm gettin'\#real damn tired\#of seeing clowns.
Yick,\. I'm\#sick of this\#"natural paradise."
Nothing but\#dead trees\#and dead\#people up here.
When these jersey wackos\#clear out,\. I'm hauling\#ass back to my apartment.
I leave Downtown\#for a week,\. one\#week,\. and this is\#what I come back to.
What bollocks.
No farther.
Stench of blood's\#so strong I can smell\#it from over here.
Everyone who wears\#those jerseys is a\#nutcase,\. but those\#guys across the bridge?
Well, that's like\#insanity squared.
Or maybe\#even cubed.
I never was\#good at math.
Whew!\. What a\#close encounter!
That fat fucker\#was two seconds\#away from caving\#my skull in.
Good thing\#Old Man Denkins\#stopped by to give\#him a lead breakfast.
Everyone in\#the camp is\#scared shitless.
I guess seeing a\#crazy old bitch waving\#a shotgun around\#would have that effect.
Man,\. it has\#gotten so\#boooooring\#around here.
Might be\#time for this\#stud muffin\#to hit the legs...
Lucrative tea!
Hey, Arnesto!\.\#Come back!
I was just\#messin' around!\|\#I'm not actually\#gonna crush your head!
Arnestoooo!
Looks like\#trouble up ahead.
Psh,\. nothin'\#we can't handle.
He'll be in\#a world of hurt\#if he gets in\#our way,\. HA HA!
Well,\. let's\#take things\#carefully-\^
Y-yo,\. what're\#you guys doing\#standing around\#out in the open?!
Didn't you hear\#the bell ringing?!
Bell?\| Yeah,\.\#we were the\#ones who-\^
Oh, there's no\#time to explain.
Hurry, come\#inside my cabin.
It's the only\#way you're gonna\#get out of this alive.
How do we\#know this isn't\#some kind of trap?
Yeah,\. why\#should we be\#trustin' you?
Just...\| please,\.\#come on.\. For\#your own sakes.
He'll be here\#any minute now...
Guess we should\#humor the kid.
That place\#across the chasm...
They've gone\#completely mad.
God have\#mercy on\#their souls.
And ours,\. too.
H-hey,\. stay back!
Huh?\| Is there\#something wrong?
You don't\#wanna go\#across this\#bridge, man.
The people\#on the other\#side,\. they're...
They've just\#completely lost it!
If you're talking\#about the jersey\#guys,\. don't worry,\.\#we're used to them.
No, man,\.\#these aren't\#your ordinary\#jerseyheads.
They're obsessed\#with blood!
It's totally\#taken over\#their minds...
Does that\#sound like\#something you\#wanna deal with?
We'll be fine.\|\#We've handled worse\#than some blood-\#loving sports fans.
Man...\| You're\#either really\#ballsy,\. or really\#fuckin' stupid.
But if\#you insist,\.\#it's your life.
Just,\. whatever\#you do,\. do NOT\#ring the bell in\#the westmost cabin.
For any reason.
Can I\#ask why?
Just don't, okay?
Back when the\#camp was still normal,\.\#we'd use the bell to\#call everyone together.
But now there\#are some people\#we'd rather not\#have come back.
Capiche?
Loud and clear.
Alright...
Go on, then,\.\#and don't say\#I didn't warn you.
I just wish\#we could go\#back to the\#old days...
Back when roasted\#marshmallows and took\#legally-questionable hikes\#up the mountainside...
Ancient Ring!
Vacant pedestal.
A number of trauma kits, all full of supplies.
Welcome back,\. mortals!
Come for some\#of my magic\#healing wares?
Then look\#no further!\.\#They shall\#be yours!
For a reasonable price.
Come back anytime!
Then they\#shall be yours!
Hmm...\| now\#where did\#I put that\#extra gauze?
Huh...?\. Hello?
Ahhh!\.\^
H-hey,\. you're\#not supposed\#to be awake!
The anesthetic\#should've kept\#you out for at\#least an hour!
Oh, sorry...\|\#I have\#trouble\#sleeping.
What?!\. How\#does that even-\^
Hey, wait\#a minute...
.\..\..\.So THIS is\#the source of\#your "miraculous"\#healing abilities.
Pft, some\#magician\#you are...
...selling us a\#horribly overpriced\#first-aid kit.
Please...\| don't\#tell anyone.
I have a real\#reputation\#around here.
If they\#found out\#I was a\#fraud...
Well, that'd\#be on\#you,\. then.
For trying\#to fool everyone\#with your schemes.
I'm begging\#you here...
I'll do anything,\.\#just so long as\#you keep a secret.
Anything, huh?
How about\#parting with\#some of\#these kits?
My trauma kits?!\.\#A-are you sure?
Yeah.\. They\#could really\#come in handy.
...Alright.\| That's\#a fair deal.
But I can't\#give them to\#you for free.
They're too\#rare for that.
But, I'll sell\#them cheap,\.\#just for you.
Deal.
Now, if\#you don't\#mind,\. lie\#back down.
I need to\#finish the operation.
You made\#a mistake.
Turn around\#and we might\#let you live.
*Go back.*
*Refuse.*
.\..\..\|No.
The Joy...
It will\#make you\#whole again...
That\#poor kid...
He had\#no idea what\#he found.
We should\#have kept\#far away\#from them.
But alas.\|\#Too late now.
I only\#hope his\#last moments\#are filled with joy.
Joy to\#the world...
The Lord\#has come.
How beautiful\#the peace\#will be...
Why did\#you come\#here,\. old man?
Why did\#you seek\#this accursed\#hideout?
I...\| I just\#found it.
This isn't\#a place you\#just "find."
But I understand.
You're desperate.
Here,\. take\#it, then.
He gave you some Joy.
I don't\#want this.
We both\#know that\#isn't true.
Enjoy it\#while it lasts.
A pile of those masks.
Annointed by blood.
If it looks\#like blood,\. smells\#like blood,\. tastes\#like blood...
It might\#be food coloring.
Learn the\#difference!
It all comes\#down to the texture.
If it FEELS\#like blood,\. then\#it probably is.
Hey,\. is someone\#fuckin' around with\#that old bell tower?
Thought I told\#everyone to leave\#that thing alone.
Makes my\#tinnitus act\#up like crazy!
Bitches have\#no common\#courtesy these days...
Since the beginning of\#humanity,\. the blood has\#been our universal link.
No matter what color,\.\#what shape,\. or what size\#a man is,\. cut him open\#and he shall bleed.
Blood is our\#true language, our\#most arcane treasure.
We are blessed\#to have been gifted\#with such a thing!
Annoint yourself in\#blood and you will see.
You will see the\#truth of this world.
The bell hath tolled...
Our very own\#harbinger of doom...
Demise rides\#on the horizon.
And it rides...\|\#on a wave\#of blood...
Wooooo!\|\#Look at\#all this\#blood!
Blood everywhere!\|\#Blood on the floor,\.\#blood on the walls,\.\#blood on my head!

Wouldn't be\#the first time!

Three's a party...

Thoroughly...\|\#entertaining...
Did you just\#ring that bell,\.\#old man?
.\..\..\.And if\#I did?
Oh,\. it's nothin'.
You've just made\#a very interesting choice.
You'll see\#what I mean\#soon enough.
Thanks for\#that one,\. bro.
Never knew just\#how bonkers these\#jersey guys were 'till\#I saw them up close.
Here,\. for\#helping me out.

To even be\#in his presence...\|\#it brings shame\#to his name!
Forgive me,\.\#O blood god!
Blood is leaking from the faucet...

Hellooooo!
Anybody home?
I know there's\#someone in there!
Come on out!\.\#I just wanna\#play a little!
What happened\#to the bridge guy\#was an accident!
I won't be\#that rough with\#you,\. I promise!
Hauh...?
Well, well!
If it isn't\#old man Denkins!
I've missed\#you,\. buddy!
.\..\..\.What's the matter?\|\#Cat got your tongue?
Oh, I know!
Let's go for a\#hike up the mountain!
Just like you\#used to love-\^
I...\| I think\#it's safe to\#stand up now.
Big chair for big men.
Squirrel jerky!
Gently crackling.
He is vacant.
Oh,\. I can't\#take it anymore!
The smell!\.\#The meat!\.\#The fucking\#pink fat thing!
It's too much!
GET ME\#OUTTA HERE!
What's with\#this place?
Why is it\#filled to the\#brim with\#rotting meat?
And...\| whatever\#that guy in\#latex was.
It wasn't\#supposed to\#be like this.
It's all\#my fault.
Everything that\#happened...\| is\#because of me.
This is\#my penance.
My purgatory.
Witness now,\. children.
Witness now...\|\#my cardinal sin.
It is no longer operational.
Someone's idea of a home.
They have been crushed.
I hate\#this island.
It is jammed.
It's playing a calming song.
The music has stopped.
My friends...
I apologize.
These doors\#can be a\#bit sticky\#sometimes.
It seems we've\#found ourselves\#at an impasse.
We are\#friends.\.\#As such...
I must be\#honest with you.
I never\#intended to\#let you leave\#this place.
This studio...
What's\#left of it...
It is my\#little slice\#of paradise.
Where all the\#worries go away.
But it is\#unsustainable.
They will\#flood this place.
They will\#kill me.\. Kill\#me for the\#sake of it.
There's nothing\#I can do but fight.
Fight to\#survive.
Fight back\#every attack\#on my ideals.
We don't\#have to\#do this.
We can\#leave\#you be.
Let you\#live in peace.
Alex,\.\#friend...
You simply\#cannot trust\#anyone anymore.
Trust is\#caustic.\.\.\#Parasitic.
I have\#to do this.
Then I'm\#going to hurt\#you,\. friend.
I won't\#hold back.
Alex.\. When\#our ideals are\#threatened...
We can\#choose\#to die...
...alongside\#our ideals...
...or we can\#choose to fight,\.\#to protect them.
I have\#chosen\#to fight.
I'm sorry\#for this,\. but...
Goodbye, Alex.
I will bury you\#someplace nice.
Hey, guys,\.\#I'm back!
Who wants jerky?!
I don't think\#I brought enough.
All of this\#just so he\#could wear some\#tight pants...\. HA HA!
You searched the bin.
Nothing but paper scraps.
Antique incense holder.
Esoteric mural. The paint is quite old.
Balance...\| the\#most essential\#principle of yoga...
One day we\#will stand on\#the edge of reality.
You must know\#balance,\. or you\#will fall off the side.
You are\#the most\#balanced\#of them all.
We will\#be forever\#thankful.
Listen to\#the universe...\.\#feel the pulse\#of its heart...
Through meditation,\.\#even the deaf can hear.
I hear\#it now...
A new\#peace...\.\#for all\#of us.
You are\#the tree...\|\#tall,\. mighty,\.\#unwavering...
No breeze\#will shake\#you now.
You have\#stood against\#the wind and\#triumphed.
We bless\#your spirit.
Eyes forward...\|\#Mind forward...
See the end...\.\#Hear the end...\.\#Know the end...\.
This isn't\#the end...
Maybe...\. it's\#only the\#beginning.
Peace befits\#the unclouded,\.\#those who know\#and are known...
Time befits\#the peaceful,\.\#those who have\#touched the universe...
A heavy\#buren has\#been lifted.
Time heals\#all wounds.
Master Zhnebrowski\#awaits you in\#his tea room.
Go forth\#now and\#be enlightened.
Be like the\#dew on the\#tip of a leaf...
Fleeting,\|\#yet serene.
I feel\#serenity...
Has peace\#truly returned?
Good\#luck, Alex.
May you\#find your peace.
Friends!
Welcome,\#welcome.
Please,\.\#have\#a seat.
The tea\#is warm.
Oh my God,\#warm tea.
Thought this\#went out with\#the old world.
Enjoyin'\#it, Lucky?
It is\#good,\#Joel.
It is\#good.
Hey,\. these\#chairs are\#awfully small!
You expect\#me to squeeze\#into one of these?!
Oh,\. I know!
You guys can\#talk it out while\#I'll go grab us\#some refreshments!
Don't have\#too much fun\#without me, HA HA!
It is a fine\#day for tea\#with friends.
A yoga\#studio.
But of\#course.
Yoga is how we\#access the mystic\#properties of our bodies.
Just a few\#minutes a day\#can do wonders\#for your health.
Limber joints,\.\#a clear mind...
Doesn't that\#sound nice?
It does.\. My joints\#have started to\#wear out on me.
Trust me,\#Alex,\. yoga\#is the real deal.
How do you\#think I got these\#killer glutes?
That was\#all stretchin'\#and meditatin'.
Your friend\#here speaks\#the truth!
Hmm,\#I dunno.
I tried\#yoga once,\.\#way back when.
Couldn't really\#get into it.
Guess I just\#couldn't get into\#a good "state of\#mind,"\. or whatever.
It can be\#difficult for\#beginners to\#relax themselves.
The world\#is full of\#problems...
And any one\#of them could\#disrupt your\#inner balance.
I had wanted\#to ask you\#something.
What is it\#that brought\#you here?
To scavenge.
I was just travelling.
I thought\#that,\. well...
Olathe\#drains you.
I came from\#Garbage Island.
Food,\.\#water...
They don't\#come around\#that often.
So I've been\#looking for supplies.
Things to\#keep us\#going.
I wouldn't\#steal from you.
It's different now.
You have\#my word.
Oh, please.
No need\#to apologise.
This world...\.\. it\#is a cruel place.
The things\#I have done\#to survive...
Maybe we\#are two peas\#in a pod, haha!
Of course!
My clothes...
They are\#drenched\#in blood.
Kidding,\.\#kidding!
Just an\#expression.
Sometimes it\#takes people\#by surprise.
I get a\#good kick\#out of that.
Truthfully,\.\#your attire\#suits you.
Is that a\#compliment?
Indeed!
Friends,\.\#I do not\#judge you.
This place\#is not one\#of judgment.
I was\#travelling.
Where to?
Well...\.\#anywhere.
I think...
I think a\#better place\#exists out there.
Better\#than here.
Some\#place...\.\.\#a city.
How interesting.
But you\#don't know\#where this\#place is.
But I've\#heard\#stories.
They say\#it's east.
Seems like\#paradise how\#they describe it.
Some things\#are too good\#to be true.
That may be.
But there's\#a chance.
And would\#you take\#that chance?
In a heartbeat.
Of course,\.\#of course.
This place\#is not your\#final destination.
You have\#to keep moving.
...I think so.
A very\#yogic sentiment.
If I don't\#keep going...
...everything\#I've done up\#to this point...
...the life\#I've lived...
It'd all\#be for\#nothing.
Indeed.
A human\#perspective.
But the id\#runs counter\#to the ego.
Perhaps an\#understanding\#has been reached.
By whom?
Another\#question, if\#you wouldn't\#mind,\. Lucky.
Your hat\#friend.\. It's\#what he\#calls you.
Please,\#it's Alex.
A pleasure.
Your\#question?
Alex...\.\.\#what is your\#idea of peace?
No more fighting.
Somewhere with my friends.
No more\#fighting.
Seems simple.
Is that\#what you\#truly desire?
I've lived an\#interesting life.
When you\#lose everything...
You sometimes\#forget what\#loss means.
Peace\#sounds nice.
But I just\#want all this\#fighting to end.
The world\#is dying.
No reason\#for us to die\#before it, eh?
I don't\#see it\#like that.
There are\#reasons to live\#that are not just\#to avoid death.
You talk\#big words,\.\#yoga man.
You consider\#yourself a\#philosopher?
You cannot\#understand the\#world without first\#understanding yourself.
It is like\#clearing a\#foggy lens.
Somewhere...
Somewhere with\#all my friends.
That is your\#definition of peace?
Two is a\#party.\. One\#man starves.
Without Joel,\.\#I would be\#a dead man.
Aw, now\#don't get all\#sentimental on me.
I'm serious.
Don't forget\#about me, Alex.
Wouldn't\#dream\#of it, Geen.
I'm always glad\#that you're around.
Heh...\.\.\#same to you.
That's\#nice, friend.
I must admit,\.\#I mistook you\#at first glance.
You are much\#more karmically\#balanced than\#I once thought.
Who knows?
Maybe I'm\#sitting across\#from a friend\#right now.
You are\#too kind, Alex.
Tea\#still warm?
Definitely.
I'm beginning\#to form a\#picture here.
Now...
Imagine\#this peace\#as a tree.
It is\#cared for,\.\#it grows tall...
An old oak.
Then, one\#day,\. it is\#torn down.
Human error,\#malice, whatever\#the reason may be.
That tree\#will never\#grow again.
Gone forever?
If your\#sense of\#peace is\#threatened...
What\#would\#you do?
What actions\#would you take?
I would run.
I would fight.
Not a\#fighting man?
Some\#things...
Some things\#can't be fought.
You can't\#win everything.
Life is about\#choosing your battles.
Practical.
But can\#a man run\#forever?
And I\#don't hope\#to find out.
I guess\#it is what\#I do best.
I'd fight back,\.\#as best I can.
Would you kill?
Would you\#kill to protect\#your peace?
That was\#uncalled for.
Fighting is...\.\.\#inevitable, in\#this new world.
Peace, whatever\#form it may take...
...must be\#defended\#at all costs.
On that,\.\#I believe\#we agree.
Peace.
I would understand.
I think an\#understanding\#can always\#be reached.
There is\#good in\#everyone.
You have\#seen the\#world, Alex.
Some people\#are simply animals.
That's just\#not true.
Those jerseys,\.\#they inebriate\#the mind itself.
The culmination\#of man's mistakes.
The jersey\#is a corrupting\#force, but...
There is\#always still hope.
No one\#is ever too\#far gone.
There is\#always a time\#for change.
...Yes.
I am reaching\#an epiphany here.
This has\#been a most\#enlightening\#conversation.
I thought\#most people\#had gone\#mad by now.
Having\#someone\#to talk to...
An intellectually\#stimulating chat...
It is good\#for your health.
Spend a little\#time outside your\#own head for a change,\. eh?
Chatting\#over some\#nice tea...
I've\#missed this.
Us normal\#people,\. we're\#a dying breed.
Everyone outside\#this studio is a\#bonafide lunatic.
Let's enjoy this\#while we can.
There are\#plenty of good\#people left.
Maybe you\#believe so,\.\#but I doubt it.
There's a\#talented chef\#down in the town.
We helped\#him,\. and he's\#helped us.
A friend\#of ours now.
He's a\#good man.
I trust\#your word.
Another\#question, if\#you please.
Hit me.
Can\#peace exist...
...even in\#a world of\#violence?
Of\#course\#it can.
I believe\#in peace.
Don't you?
Any attempt\#for peace,\.\#for sanity...
...was crushed\#beneath the\#weight of the\#new world.
I learned\#this long ago.
It's destined\#to drown in a\#sea of jerseys.
And I\#will go down\#with my ship.
That's noble.
But, there\#is still hope.
Oh,\.\#come\#on now.
You've\#seen them.
Talking of\#hope, down there.
See how\#quickly they\#bash your\#head in.
How does\#one protect\#peace without\#using violence?
You can't.
There is always hope.
Peace,\. it\#has to be\#preserved.
Or it\#will be\#lost forever.
Maybe it's\#the one thing\#left worth\#fighting for.
If that\#is so...
If peace\#must be\#tended to\#by force...
Then perhaps\#peace was a fool's\#endeavor all along.
I've seen\#what happens\#to those\#without hope.
Stuck in\#their own\#ways, with\#one solution...
To combat\#violence\#with violence.
They were\#massacred.
People at\#their core...
They\#are good.
There is\#something there\#worth caring for.
An understanding\#can always be reached...
Even when\#it seems impossible.
Violence doesn't\#always have to\#be the answer.
Without striving\#for something different...
Without\#striving\#for hope...
You will be\#doomed by fate.
Perhaps...
Perhaps I\#was wrong.
Friends...
This has\#been an\#illuminating\#experience.
Has it?
You have\#a good soul.
I believe you've\#got a goal and the\#passion to reach it.
This\#conversation...
...has made\#me realize\#some things.
I will\#definitely\#consider...
...workshopping\#my routine around\#these new principles.
Oh, you\#flatter me.
I'm an\#old man now.
I'm no\#philosopher.
You may\#believe that, Alex.
I consider you\#a true friend.
And I\#mean that.
You're a\#welcoming\#man, Milo.
I consider\#you a\#friend\#as well.
Same\#goes here.
A friend\#of theirs\#is a friend\#of mine.
You...\.\.\#you may\#leave now.
I have\#some serious\#thinking to do.
About my\#life, my future.
Go now,\#friends.
I am\#rooting\#for you.
I am a\#smart man.
There is\#an elephant\#in the room\#I must address.
I need\#to know\#something.
Something\.\#you\. may\#be aware of.
Is Jeremy dead?
Jeremy\#Denkins.
He lives\#up here.
Surely, you\#must have\#seen him.
Tell me\#the truth.
No (Lie)
He came\#at us wearing\#the jersey.
There was\#no saving him.
Even he\#got the\#jersey, eh?
Mighty\#disappointing.
I consider\#myself a student\#of perserverance.
But it seems\#even this studio\#may reach its\#end soon as well.
Was he\#a good man?
He was a\#slave to fate,\.\#much like us.
This studio\#was born with\#him,\.\. and it will\#die with him.
There is\#nothing left\#to be sorry for.
You lie.
I wasn't\#sure if it was a\#touchy subject.
I would have\#preferred the truth.
But it's\#a nice thing,\.\#a white lie.
Still.
Friends,\.\#it is time we\#end this session.
Our tea\#has gone cold.
A sour\#note to\#end on.
True,\#friend.
True.
You may see\#yourselves\#to the door.
Please do\#not lie to me.
But I\#must\#know...
How many\#people have\#you killed?
I did\#what I had\#to, to survive.
This world\#is unkind.
You want\#to shame\#me for that?
I mean\#no malice.
But to\#take a life...
...eventually,\.\#you learn\#to love it.
You must\#avoid that\#at all costs.
Lest you\#become a\#machine.
You speak\#from experience?
I do.
But you\#are in good\#company,\. Alex.
I know\#what this\#world is like.
I have\#killed before.
You place\#a grain of\#sand on\#the ground...
You\#place\#another...
When does it\#become a pile?
I have forgiven\#that,\. over time.
Learned to\#live with myself.
Have you?
The tea\#is cold now.
Alex,\.\#friend.
I simply do\#not believe you.
What...?
Some\#problems...
...must\#be solved\#with violence.
You saw\#that outside.
These people,\.\#they cannot be\#reasoned with.
The\#jersey\#corrupts.
But its\#influence\#is not\#infinite.
There exists\#reason in\#this world still.
You tell\#that to the\#corpses outside.
As for me,\.\#I simply...
...cannot be\#as optimistic\#as you are.
You can\#still try.
I've tried all\#my life,\. Alex.
But everything\#I had has now\#been taken away.
Only my\#studio\#remains.
...I'm sorry,\.\#my friends.
I believe\#I am running\#a bit of a fever.
If you\#wish to\#leave now,\.\#you may.
Thank you\#for the tea.
Of course,\#friends.
...Farewell.
Got some lucrative tea!
Fine porcelain tea kettle.
Hollow bones.
Got an Antique Rifle!

This is\#all YOUR fault!

You think\#it's funny\#to lie,\. huh?!
...Sorry,\. but\#you're actually\#pretty ugly.

No promises\#that they'll\#go easy\#on you.
Figures\#as much...
Hold it,\.\#pallie!
You're walkin'\#straight into\#Rando terf.
One wrong\#step and you'll\#have a bullet\#in your head!
They're not\#THAT bad.
I've checked\#this place\#out before.
The guys here\#are a just little\#disoriented.
Give them\#some time and\#I'm sure they'll\#be much friendlier.
Oh,\. so\#you wanna\#get chummy\#with 'em?
Don't you\#know they're\#here to destroy\#Garbage Island?!
All our\#riches...
They\#wanna\#tear it\#all down!
Relax.
They can't\#do much without\#Rando's support.
You guys\#will be fine.
Says you!
You can hang\#out with your\#Rando buds\#all you want.
I ain't settin'\#one foot into\#that boot camp.
If ya don't\#get shot, I'll\#be here waitin'.
Darry temporarily left your party.
That's silly.
They can't\#be THAT bad.
Most of\#them left\#anyway.
I doubt they'll\#mind if I give\#the place a\#quick look.
Tsk,\. your\#funeral, bud!
I'll\#be here\#waitin'.
Don't let\#'em stink-\#shame you!
'Bout\#damn time!
Can't stand\#any of this\#Rando funk!
Patrick, for the\#last time, I don't\#know where they\#put the toolbox.
Just fix the\#God damn\#car already.
Oh, for\#the love of...
Patrick,\#you dumb...
...I knew\#something\#smelled off.
Who're you,\#rag man?
I'm trying\#to get off\#this island.
Join the\#club, pal.
All of us want to\#ditch this place, but\#our higher-ups have\#made that quite impossible.
Why did the\#rest of the\#Army leave in\#such a hurry?
Hell if\#I know.
Last I heard,\#Rando is\#"looking" for\#something.
Couldn't\#be assed to\#give us any\#more than that...
It's just so\#frustrating.
We were\#doing good\#work here.
Believe it or not, we\#were going to turn\#this trash heap back\#into an actual society.
Really?\.\#Garbage\#Island?
I know, it\#sounds insane,\#but it was true.
We had everything\#primed and ready\#to make it happen.
But then the Big R\#went and threw all\#that out the window\#so he can "look."
What a\#fuckin'\#shame.
I'm sorry\#about that.
Thanks,\#I guess.
But now I'm\#in a pickle.
I have all these\#orders to give, but\#no one here feel\#like listening to me.
Without Rando,\.\#I have no power.
How are we\#supposed to\#make our dream\#come true now?
Well, I\#can help.
Don't pull\#my leg, man.
Not in the\#mood for jokes.
No, I\#mean it.
Just tell me\#what to do.
I'll get\#it done.
You're\#serious?
And they\#said there\#was nothing\#here but trash.
Here.\.\#Everything\#you need is\#in this letter.
You got a Rando Parcel!
Come back\#when you get\#something done.
I'll make\#it worth\#your while.
Rookie.
Ask About Water
Ask About Coins
Ask About Assassination
Do you know\#where I could\#find clean water?
If I knew that,\#I wouldn't\#need you to\#look for it.
That's\#true...
I'll be\#straight\#with you.
We already combed\#over most of the\#island looking for\#any trace of water.
The most we ever\#found was in some\#old plastic bottles.
And those\#barely had\#enough for\#a swig or two.
So is\#there really\#any clean\#water here?
I refuse to believe\#that there isn't at\#least ONE place\#you can still find it.
But it's\#nowhere\#out in\#the open.
You'll have\#to head deep\#into the bowels\#of Garbage Island.
Maybe\#even\#literally...
I see.\.\#Thanks\#for the\#insight.
Who\#should I\#give these\#coins to?
That's up\#to you.
But,\. I should\#probably give\#you a little\#heads-up.
Most of\#the people\#here don't\#respect Rando.
So even\#though you're\#giving the coins\#out for free...
...chances are a\#lot of folks will\#outright refuse\#to take them.
So who\#WILL\#take\#them?
You're just\#going to have\#to find that out\#for yourself.
Keep asking around, and\#you're bound to find a\#few guys who will take\#them off your hands.
Only one\#coin per\#person,\#though.
Need to\#avoid creating\#any monopolies\#from the get-go.
Gotcha.\.\#I'll talk to\#everyone\#I see, then.
That should\#get things done\#quickly enough.
Why do\#I need to\#"assassinate"\#somebody?
Believe me,\.\#this wouldn't be\#my first choice.
But this is\#an order that\#comes from high\#up the ladder.
For the sake of\#Garbage Island,\.\.\#Larry Davis has to die.
If you're\#not up to\#this, I can\#make some-\.\^
No,\.\#it's fine.
I understand\#how important\#this must be.
Good, good.
But just to\#be sure, the man\#I'm looking for is\#"Larry Davis,"\. right?
Yep.\#Ever\#heard\#of him?
The name\#rings a\#few bells...
Well, that's\#your guy.
Just pinch\#him quick\#and bring\#me the body.
No need\#to drag\#this one out.
I'm on it.
Let me\#know when\#you get some\#work done.
I found\#clean water.
Really?\.\#No shit?
None\#at all.
That might\#just be the\#best thing I've\#heard all day.
Did you\#get a sample?
I did,\.\#but...
But what?
Well, it's\#a little...
Here, see\#for yourself.
Handed over the Bottle of "Water."
This is\#water?
The closest\#thing I could\#find to it, anyway.
And this\#stuff is...\.\#drinkable?
I figured\#you would\#be the judge\#of that.
I guess the\#letter DID say\#I would be the\#one testing it...
If this is\#what it takes\#for progress...
...then down\#the hatch.
What a\#peculiar\#consistency.
Where did\#you even\#get this stuff?
It might\#be better\#if I told\#you later.
Well,\. it\#definitely\#has a water-\#like taste.
And it\#definitely\#IS drinkable.
As weird\#and\. thick\.\#as it may be.
So I'll\#chalk this\#up as a\#success.
Good\#work,\#rookie.
Say,\. you\#thirsty?
Then have\#yourself\#a drink.
You were rewarded for your work!
Got a REAL Bottle of Water!
That one's\#from my\#personal\#inventory.
Don't tell\#any of the\#others where\#you got it.
My lips\#are sealed.
That's\#what\#I like\#to hear.
Keep up\#the good work.
If you need\#help with anything,\.\#just let me know.
I got\#rid of all\#those coins.
Oh, great.
Was wondering\#when you would-\.\^
You didn't\#stick them\#all up your\#ass,\. did you?
No\..\..\..\.?
What\#kind of\#question\#is that?
Uhh,\#well...
Let's just say\#that we tried\#doing this before.
And something\#like that may or\#may not have happened.
Well,\.\. I\#did what\#I was told.
They've\#all been\#given away.
Good,\#good.
Now the groundwork\#has been laid for\#the Rando economy\#to one day flourish.
Though, for\#the time being...
...you'll be\#better off\#with these.
Got 8 magazines!
Keep up\#the good\#work, rookie.
I took\#care of\#Larry\#Davis.
And about\#damn time.
Guy's been on\#our wanted list\#for God knows\#just how long.
You got\#the body?
Though,\. I\#suggest you\#hold your nose.
Handed over the Warm Bag.
Ah, come\#on,\. it can't\#be that ba-\^
Suh-weet\.\#JESUS!
I think\#I'm gonna\#throw up...
I tried\#to warn you.
Is this\#really his\#corpse?
It smells like\#it's already...\.\#decomposing.
That's\#Larry,\#alright.
But you can\#check the bag\#if you're still\#not convinced.
I'll take your\#word for it.
That's one\#way to lose\#your appetite.
Anyway.
Thanks for\#taking care\#of this one.
I know it's\#not easy,\.\#killin' a man.
But some\#people just\#have to go.
"For the\#greater good,"\#and all that.
It's all in\#a day's work.
I'm used\#to taking\#out the trash.
Now, as\#for your\#recompense...
How about\#something to\#wash that taste\#out of your mouth?
Got Potato Liquor!
Keep on\#makin' me\#proud, rookie.
That's everything\#taken care of.
It's hardly\#even been\#an hour.
It's\#the\#truth.
Take a\#look at\#the letter.
Returned the Rando Parcel.
...Holy shit.
I didn't\#think you'd\#actually pull\#through like this.
I'm a man\#of my word.
If there's\#something\#to be done,\.\#I do it.
God.
To think...
...some guy in rags\#would be a better\#soldier than all of\#my men combined.
No...\.\. you're\#no rookie\#anymore.
Private Alex.
Take this.
I'd like to\#officially induct\#you into the\#Rando Army.
You were rewarded for all of your work!
Received a Rando Patch!
Private,\. huh?
Has a nice\#ring to it.
It does,\#doesn't it?
Now that you're\#a real Rando man,\.\#we can get you\#hooked up with-\^
Unfortunately,\#I'm going to\#have to decline\#the invitation.
H-huh?
But,\.\#you're\#such a\#great fit!
The Army could\#really use a\#go-getter\#guy like you!
And you've\#already proven\#yourself to be\#a good soldier!
What\#gives?
I appreciate\#your sentiments.
Really, I do.
But this\#isn't my\#kind of\#place.
I've got to\#keep going,\.\#get off this\#awful island.
Find somewhere\#better for me.
You're dead\#set on this?
Completely.
That breaks\#my heart.
But,\. I'm\#not one to\#keep a man\#tied down.
If you want\#to leave, then\#that's how it is.
It was nice\#to have you\#while it lasted.
The\#pleasure\#is all mine.
If you\#ever change\#your mind...
...just show 'em\#that patch and say\#"Hector" sent you.
You've\#got it.
Then\#goodbye,\. Alex.
May you\#find your\#place someday.
Godspeed,\.\#soldier.
Obliterated.
Joel?\.\#Where are we?
Someplace\#outta\#the sun.
You\#nearly had\#heatstroke.
Found this\#place before\#things could\#get worse.
Oh.\.\#Thanks Joel.
What are\#you doing?
Shh!\#Quiet, rags.\.\#Don't biff\#my focus.
Ugh, isn't it\#obvious?
I'm looking\#for something.
Something vaguely\#shaped like...\#A military\#caravan.
But with\#more skulls.
Yeah, I'm\#looking\#for that.
Where the\#fuck did\#they go?
I've been standing\#here for hours,\#and all I can\#see are those...
God damn\#wastes.
Not a\#hint of\#life in\#that place.
Did they\#really just\#vanish?
Maybe these\#trashmen\#are right...
...Nice day,\.\#isn't it?
Yeah,\#it's pretty.
Pretty sky,\#pretty birds.
Pretty\#flowers.
Now I'm\#pretty, too.
Scoot closer to Chie?
Scoot closer.
Stay still.
You're\#very\#pretty.
Hey, what\#do you want\#to do when\#you grow up?
When\#you're\#an adult?
Adult is\#a big\#word, Alex.
How am\#I supposed\#to know about\#that stuff?
Well, you\#must've at\#least thought\#about it,\. right?
Girls don't\#get to do\#the things\#that boys do.
You can\#do anything\#you want.
You can\#be a movie\#star, a singer,\#an artist-\.\^
Every girl\#I know talks\#about that stuff.
To act,\.\#to sing,\.\#to paint.
I don't\#want that.
I wanna\#be a firefigher,\#or an astronaut.
Something cool.
Do you ever\#wonder if there\#are places even\#prettier than this?
Sometimes.\.\#But I can't\#see those.
But it's\#gotta be\#out there,\#right?
If you go\#far enough\#you'll find\#anything.
We\#should\#do that.
Go somewhere.
I can't.\.\#Beth needs me.
She can\#handle things\#for a while.
We won't\#be gone long.
...Have you\#ever been\#to the city?
It's alright,\.\#but it's\#so loud.
That just\#means it's\#working.
Everyone\#there is\#working.
That's\#not true.
There were\#bums all over\#the streets.
They're just\#down on\#their luck.
They'll get\#back up\#eventually.
But what\#if they don't?
Well...\|\#they will.
I don't\#believe that.
I just\#wish there\#was more\#HERE.
It's pretty,\.\#but it's\#missing\#something.
Like what?
Something fun.
Something happy.
.\..\..\.Are you\#not happy?
It could\#be better.
What\#would\#you add?
To make\#it better?
Oh, an\#amusement park.
I've always\#wanted to ride\#a rollercoaster.
That would\#be cool.
And a\#zoo,\. with\#little goats.
The\#cute ones.
I like\#it, I\#like it.
And, and...\.\.\#a train\#station.
Huh?\.\#Train\#station?
Yeah.\.\#We could\#go anywhere\#with that.
And it'd\#be easy.\.\#And fun.
Reach for Chie's hand?
Reach.
Do not.
Ooooh!
Look\#at that!
C'mon,\#Alex!
Sigh...\.\.\#Chie...
You're\#a good\#friend,\.\#Alex.
.\..\..\.You\#mean\#that?
I'm glad\#you're here.
Aww...
It jumped\#the gorge.
Hey,\.\#squirt.
Lovely\#weather, eh?
Are you\#from the\#government?
Oh, no.
I was\#just, uh...\.\#at a wedding.
My sister's\#wedding.
You should've\#been there.
The cake\#was amazing.
Run\#along,\#squirt.
Enjoy\#the day.

Well, except for\#that gentleman\#with the gold tooth.
Nice guy.
But besides\#him,\. no one\#ever comes\#through here!
And when they\#do, it's just to call\#me rude names\#like "shrimp dick."
If you could\#spare even a\#couple mags...
...I'd be able\#to get back\#on my feet.
I guess\#I'll take\#a look.
That's what\#I wanted\#to hear!
Step right\#up, find\#something\#you like!
Welcome\#back, mister!
Anything\#catch your eye?
While you were\#away, I took the\#time to restock\#a couple things.
You can\#thank me later!

No, Alex!

Research notes. They read:
"...thank God for Mayor Gerald.
"With his latest grant, we can continue\#our research on the recent prototype.
"And we're finally\#getting somewhere, too.
"The last batch of subjects\#have far outlived the lifespans\#of the previous control group.
"We're on a good track here.
"Just a little more time, and\#I know we can make something\#worth presenting to the higher-ups."
"...tests have once again\#proved to be unsuccessful.
"As with the previous prototype,\#subjects eventually undergo\#severe and bizarre mutations\#around a week after ingestion.
"Subjects almost appear fish-\#like in their mutated forms.
"Aside from their newfound fishiness,\#subjects show no extraordinary or\#otherwise note-worthy characteristics.
"Currently, no subjects have\#managed to survive past the\#point of initial mutation for any\#meaningful amount of time.
"Superiors are understandably\#disappointed with these results.
"If no other significant results\#are produced with this prototype,\#discontinuation is likely to occur."
