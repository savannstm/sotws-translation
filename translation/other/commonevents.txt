You feel old.
Agility decreased.
You got an empty bottle.
You dumped out the dirty water.

You have completed this task.
"OPERATION: LEAD A HORSE TO WATER"
"This task, should you choose to accept it,\#will see you searching for and retrieving\#clean, drinkable water from Garbage Island.
"Godspeed, brave soldier."
"It is clear to us, as living things,\#that water is a must for survival.
"Without it, no civilization can hope to survive.
"Garbage Island's water is filthy,\#utterly toxic to anyone who hasn't\#ruined their body to get used to it.
"But there was a society here before.
"There HAS to be clean water here\#somewhere, and it is your job to find it.
"When you do, retrieve a sample\#and return it to your nearest official.\#They will test it to confirm its drinkability.
"OPERATION: PAYDAY
"This task, should you choose to accept it,\#will see you laying the foundation for a new\#and revitalized economy on Garbage Island.
"While nice to look at, pornographic material\#isn't the best fit for the currency of a society.
"Understanding this, Rando has established\#a more proper form of tender: Rando Coin.
"The issue is that no one but soldiers\#of the Rando Army accept this money.
"We're going to change that,\#starting with Garbage Island.
"Enclosed in this letter\#are three Rando Coins.
"Your job is to give these Coins to three\#separate people on the island in order to\#officially establish the Rando economy.
"Under no circumstances are you to pocket\#this money and use it to buy extra rations.\#And no using it to bribe officers, either!
Inside the letter were three shiny objects.
Got some Rando Coins!
Added to key items.
"OPERATION: TAKE OUT THE TRASH
"This task, should you choose to accept it,\#will see you performing an assassination\#on the elusive leader of Garbage Island.
"Though it may appear uncivilized\#and utterly dominated by filth,\#according to our intel, Garbage\#Island DOES indeed have a ruler.
"From what the locals tell us, he is a recluse,\#hardly ever seen in the open, and has the\#terrifying ability to influence those who have\#the misfortune of listening to his sultry voice.
"It is said that he can also turn invisible,\#make your brain explode by looking at you,\#control fire and ice, and even speak Chinese.
"His name? Larry Davis.
"Such a man is obviously a danger to the\#society that Rando wishes to build here.
"It is your responsibility to find him and\#put an end to his reign of trash mysticism.
"The exact methods of this hit are up to your\#discretion. However, to prove that the deed\#has been done, the body of Larry Davis must\#be recovered and presented to an official.
"Be absolutely sure that the person\#you decide to kill is indeed Larry\#Davis; there can be no mistakes.
You checked on the Baby Fishman.
It's panting.
Put the Baby Fishman in\#your Vase of Spring Water?
Yes
No
The Baby Fishman now inhabits the Vase.
It can no longer be drunken from.
It looks happy.
It's staring at the sky.
It looks like it wants to play.
It's gurgling water.
It's sleeping.
It looks curious.
It's squirming around.
It's kicking its little feet.
It's nibbling on your rags.
It pissed in your pocket.
It's nudging you sadly.
It's worried about you.
It seems scared of you.
It doesn't like what you're doing.
It really likes Salt Crab.
It likes Geen.
It likes your new clothes.
It's staring at your Fishy Jerky.
It's glad you're alright.
Feed it some Domestic Jerky?
It seems to be full.
Lost a Domestic Jerky.
It really, really likes it!
The Baby Fishman has become stronger.
Level up!
Learned Shock Current!
Feed it some Mystery Jerky?
Lost a Mystery Jerky.
It seems to like it!
The Baby refused to eat.
It wants something more filling.
Some better Jerky should suffice.
It likes it!
It really likes it!
Learned Mucus Blast!

"In case I forget."
You examine the inflatable head next to the\#decapitated mannequin torso.
The green slime from the torso's neck hole\#is awfully sticky...
Attach the head to the torso?
The head fits perfectly.
Got a jerryrigged doll!

"CHAPTER 1: INTIMIDATION"
"One of the most important aspects of war\#is being able to challenge your opponent\#mentally as well as physically.
"To this end, intimidation is a major\#component of any fighter's toolkit.
"If you can get inside your enemy's head,\#convince them that you are the mightier\#combatant, then you have already won."
"CHAPTER 2: SCHEMING"
"As the ancient adage goes,\#knowing is half the battle.
"Only a fool goes to war without a proper\#plan of action, but a true tactician is able\#to adapt to changing circumstances.
"Even as the battle rages on, it is prudent\#to stop and observe the situation at hand.
"A moment of careful reflection may even\#reveal strategies you once thought impossible."
This page is missing.
"CHAPTER 3: DECEPTION"
"The art of trickery is one not easily\#mastered, yet so invaluable all the same.
"To deceive an opponent is to control them,\#to guide their actions as you see fit.
"But know that every lie contains a gram\#of truth. If the backbone of your battle is\#only deception, then do not be surprised\#when it suddenly snaps in half."
"CHAPTER 4: MISDIRECTION"
"In most battles, your opponent's\#focus will be entirely on you.
"As such, one of the most invaluable\#scenarios you can encounter in war\#is a situation where your enemy's\#concentration is directed somewhere else.
"A convenient way to force this\#circumstance is to fool your enemy\#into thinking that you are not their only foe.
"You may be surprised to learn just how\#far a small sleight of hand can carry you."
All of a sudden, Joel had an epiphany!
Gun Toss has become Gun Spin!
You have no salt.
